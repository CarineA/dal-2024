    "text": "2 Data transformation\nData transformation is a fundamental aspect of data analysis.\nAfter the data you need to use is imported into R, you will have to filter rows, create new columns, or join data frames, among many other transformation operations.\nIn this tutorial we will learn how to obtain summary measures and how to count occurrences using the summarise() and count() functions.\n\n2.1 Summary measures\nDuring the lecture, we have learnt two types of measures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary measures\n\n\n\nMeasures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) indicate the typical or central value of a sample.\nMeasures of dispersion (min-max, range, standard deviation) indicate the dispersion of the sample values around the central tendency value.\n\n\nWhen you work with data, you always want to get summary measures for most of the variables in the data.\nData reports usually include summary measures. It is also important to understand which summary measure is appropriate for which type of variable.\nWe have covered this in the lecture, so we won’t go over it again here. Instead, you will learn how to obtain summary measures using the summarise() function from the dplyr tidyverse package.\nsummarise() takes at least two arguments:\n\nThe data frame to summarise.\nOne or more summary functions.\n\nFor example, let’s get the mean the reaction time column RT. Easy!\n\nsummarise(shallow, RT_mean = mean(RT))\n\nGreat! The mean reaction times of the entire sample is 867 ms.\nWhat if we want also the standard deviation? Easy!\n\nsummarise(shallow, RT_mean = mean(RT), RT_sd = sd(RT))\n\n\n# This is a comment. Let's add 6 + 3.\n6 + 3\n\nNow we know that reaction times are on average 867 ms long and have a standard deviation of about 293 ms (rounded to the nearest integer).\nLet’s go all the way and also get the minimum and maximum RT values.\n\nsummarise(\n  shallow,\n  RT_mean = mean(RT), RT_sd = sd(RT),\n  RT_min = min(RT), RT_max = max(RT)\n)\n\nFab! When writing a data report, you could write something like this.\n\nReaction times are on average 867 ms long (SD = 293 ms), with values ranging from 0 to 1994 ms.\n\nWe will learn more about standard deviations from Week 4 on, but for now just think of this as a relative measure of how dispersed the data are around the mean: the higher the SD, the greater the dispersion around the mean, i.e. the greater the variability in the data.\nWhen required, you can use the median() function to calculate the median, instead of the mean(). Go ahead and calculate the median reaction times in the data. Is it similar to the mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiz 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the documentation of ?mean.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that R has a mode() function, but alas this is not the statistical mode. To get the mode of a categorical variable you can just count the occurrences of the values of that variable and the value that occurs the most is the mode!\nKeep reading to learn how to count occurrences.\n\n\n2.2 Count occurrences\nWe can use the count() function from the dplyr tidyverse package to count the number of occurrences for each value of a specific column. Let’s count how many trials are correct, i.e. let’s count occurrences in the ACC column.\nAccuracy has been coded with 0 for incorrect and 1 for correct. We will see how this is not an ideal, although very common way, of coding binary variables. For now let’s keep it as is.\nThe function count() takes the name of tibble and the name of column you want to count values in.\n\ncount(shallow, ACC)\n\nHow many correct responses are there in the shallow tibble?\nNote that you can add multiple column names, separated by commas, to get counts for the combinations of values of each column.\nTry to get counts of the combination of ACC and Group (L1 vs L2 participants). Replace ... with the right code.\n\ncount(shallow, ...)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nIn count(), include the names of the two columns you want to get counts of, separated by commas.\n\n\n\nAre there differences in accuracy between the L1 and L2 group?\n\n\n2.3 Grouping data\nSometimes you might want to get summary measures for one variable depending on different values of another variable.\nYou can use the group_by() function from the dplyr tidyverse package, together with summarise() to achieve that. Let’s see how it works.\n\ngroup_by(shallow, Group) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    RT_mean = mean(RT),\n    RT_sd = sd(RT)\n  )\n\nThe group_by() function takes at least two arguments:\n\nThe name of the tibble to group.\nThe name of the columns to group the tibble by, separated by commas.\n\nHere we are grouping shallow by Group.\nIf you are baffled by that %&gt;%, keep on reading.\n\n\n2.4 What the pipe?!\nWait, what is that thing, %&gt;%?\nIt’s called a pipe. Think of a pipe as a teleporter.\nIn the code above we are chaining two functions together using the pipe opeartor %&gt;%. The output of the first function (group_by()) is “teleported” into the second function summarise().\nThe pipe %&gt;% teleports the output of the preceding function as the first argument of the following function. The output of group_by is a (grouped) tibble, and summarise() needs a tibble as its first argument.\nThat’s why the code above works!\nIn fact, you can even use a pipe for the tibble of group_by(), like so:\n\nshallow %&gt;%\n  group_by(Group) %&gt;%\n    summarise(\n      RT_mean = mean(RT),\n      RT_sd = sd(RT)\n    )\n\nYou see that the output of the code is the same here as it is above.\nFor comparison, this is what the code would look like without the pipe.\n\ngrouped_shallow &lt;- group_by(shallow, Group)\n\nsummarise(\n  grouped_shallow,\n  RT_mean = mean(RT),\n  RT_sd = sd(RT)\n)\n\nDon’t worry too much if the concept of the pipe is not clear yet. It should become clearer later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiz 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nFor 6b., check the documentation of ?summarise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to https://github.com/stefanocoretta/infant-gestures and download the gestures.csv file in the data/ folder. This is data from the paper [A Cross-Cultural Analysis of Early Prelinguistic Gesture Development and Its Relationship to Language Development](https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.13406).\nRead the file in R.\nCalculate the following:\n\nMeasure of central tendency and dispersion for the count column (it contains the number of gestures performed by each child in different tasks).\nMeasure of central tendency and dispersion for the countcolumn grouped by month (the child’s age).\nTotal number of gestures by children (dyad).\nNumber of children by background.\n\nWrite a short paragraph where you report the measures. You can right this as comments in your R script. For examples, see above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo calculate the total number of gestures by children, you need the sum() function.\nTo calculate the number of children by background, you need the distinct() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you tried doing the exercise and couldn’t work it out?\nThe you can check the code solution here…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\ngestures %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    count_med = median(count, na.rm = TRUE),\n    count_min = min(count, na.rm = TRUE),\n    count_max = max(count, na.rm = TRUE),\n    count_range = count_max - count_min\n  )\n\ngestures %&gt;%\n  group_by(months) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    count_med = median(count, na.rm = TRUE),\n    count_min = min(count, na.rm = TRUE),\n    count_max = max(count, na.rm = TRUE),\n    count_range = count_max - count_min\n  )\n\ngestures %&gt;%\n  group_by(dyad) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    count_tot = sum(count)\n  )\n\ngestures %&gt;%\n  distinct(background, dyad) %&gt;%\n  count(background)"

Markdown is the mark-up language R Markdown is based on.\nThe main parts of an .Rmd file are the preamble, text and code chunks.\n\nPlotting\n\nggplot2 is a plotting package from the tidyverse.\n\nTo create a basic plot, you use the ggplot() function and specify data and mapping.\nThe aes() function allows you to specify aesthetics (like axes, colours, …) in the mapping argument.\nGeometries map data values onto shapes in the plot. All geometry functions are of the type geom_*().\n\nScatter plots are created with geom_point() and can be used with two numeric variables.\nBar charts are created with geom_bar() and can be used to show the counts of different levels of a categorical variable.\nStacked bar charts are created by specifying the fill aesthetic and can be used to show counts grouped by a second categorical variable.\nStacked bar charts showing proportions can be created with the argument position = \"fill\" in geom_bar().\nFaceting allows you to split the plot in different panels, based on other variables in the data. Faceting is achieved with facet_grid().\n\n\n\n\nNext week, we will start learning about statistical modelling and while doing that you will also learn how to create density and violin plots and how to customise legends, titles and labels!"

    "text": "In the tutorial last week you’ve been playing around with R, RStudio and R scripts.\nBut what if you want to import data in R?\nEasy! You can use the read_*() functions to read your files into R. But before we dive in, let’s first talk about some computer basics. (You can skip this section if it’s too basic for you.)\n\n\nFiles saved on your computer live in a specific place. For example, if you download a file from a browser (like Google Chrome, Safari or Firefox), the file is normally saved in the Download folder.\nBut where does the Download folder live? Usually, in your user folder! The user folder normally is the name of your account or a name you picked when you created your computer account. In my case, my user folder is simply called ste.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser folder\n\n\n\nThe user folder is the folder with the name of your account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to find your user folder name\n\n\n\n\n\nOn macOS\n\nOpen the Finder Preferences.\nGo to Sidebar.\nThe name next to the house icon is the name of your home folder.\n\nOn Windows\n\nRight-click an empty area on the navigation panel in File Explorer.\nFrom the context menu, select the ‘Show all folders’ and your user profile will be added as a location in the navigation bar.\n\n\n\n\nSo, let’s assume I download a file, let’s say big_data.csv, in the Download folder of my user folder.\nNow we can represent the location of the big_data.csv file like so:\nste/\n└── Downloads/\n    └── big_data.csv\nTo mark that ste and Downloads are folders, we add a final forward slash /. That simply means “hey! I am a folder!”. big_data.csv is a file, so it doesn’t have a final /.\nInstead, the file name big_data.csv has a file extension. The file extension is .csv. A file extension marks the type of file: in this the big_data file is a .csv file, a comma separated value file (we will see an example of what that looks like later).\nDifferent file type have different file extensions:\n\nExcel files: .xlsx.\nPlain text files: .txt.\nImages: .png, .jpg, .gif.\nAudio: .mp3, .wav.\nVideo: .mp4, .mov, .avi.\nEtc…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile extension\n\n\n\nA file extension is a sequence of letters that indicates the type of a file and it’s separated with a . from the file name.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can use an alternative, more succinct way, to represent the location of the big_data.csv:\nste/Downloads/big_data.csv\nThis is called a file path! It’s the path through folders that lead you to the file. Folders are separated by / and the file is marked with the extension .csv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile path\n\n\n\nA file path indicates the location of a file on a computer as a path through folders that lead you to the file.\n\n\nNow the million pound question: where does ste/ live on my computer???\nUser folders are located in different places depending on the operating system you are using:\n\nOn macOS: the user folder is in /Users/.\n\nYou will notice that there is a forward slash also before the name of the folder. That is because the /Users/ folder is a top folder, i.e. there are no folders further up in the hierarchy of folders.\nThis means that the full path for the big_data.csv file on a computer running macOS would be: /Users/ste/Downloads/big_data.csv.\n\nOn Windows: the user folder is in C:/Users/\n\nYou will notice that C is followed by a colon :. That is because C is a drive, which contains files and folders.

    "text": "In the tutorial last week you’ve been playing around with R, RStudio and R scripts.\nBut what if you want to import data in R?\nEasy! You can use the read_*() functions to read your files into R. But before we dive in, let’s first talk about some computer basics. (You can skip this section if it’s too basic for you.)\n\n\nFiles saved on your computer live in a specific place. For example, if you download a file from a browser (like Google Chrome, Safari or Firefox), the file is normally saved in the Download folder.\nBut where does the Download folder live? Usually, in your user folder! The user folder normally is the name of your account or a name you picked when you created your computer account. In my case, my user folder is simply called ste.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser folder\n\n\n\nThe user folder is the folder with the name of your account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to find your user folder name\n\n\n\n\n\nOn macOS\n\nOpen the Finder Preferences.\nGo to Sidebar.\nThe name next to the house icon is the name of your home folder.\n\nOn Windows\n\nRight-click an empty area on the navigation panel in File Explorer.\nFrom the context menu, select the ‘Show all folders’ and your user profile will be added as a location in the navigation bar.\n\n\n\n\nSo, let’s assume I download a file, let’s say big_data.csv, in the Download folder of my user folder.\nNow we can represent the location of the big_data.csv file like so:\nste/\n└── Downloads/\n    └── big_data.csv\nTo mark that ste and Downloads are folders, we add a final forward slash /. That simply means “hey! I am a folder!”. big_data.csv is a file, so it doesn’t have a final /.\nInstead, the file name big_data.csv has a file extension. The file extension is .csv. A file extension marks the type of file: in this the big_data file is a .csv file, a comma separated value file (we will see an example of what that looks like later).\nDifferent file type have different file extensions:\n\nExcel files: .xlsx.\nPlain text files: .txt.\nImages: .png, .jpg, .gif.\nAudio: .mp3, .wav.\nVideo: .mp4, .mov, .avi.\nEtc…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile extension\n\n\n\nA file extension is a sequence of letters that indicates the type of a file and it’s separated with a . from the file name.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can use an alternative, more succinct way, to represent the location of the big_data.csv:\nste/Downloads/big_data.csv\nThis is called a file path! It’s the path through folders that lead you to the file. Folders are separated by / and the file is marked with the extension .csv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile path\n\n\n\nA file path indicates the location of a file on a computer as a path through folders that lead you to the file.\n\n\nNow the million pound question: where does ste/ live on my computer???\nUser folders are located in different places depending on the operating system you are using:\n\nOn macOS: the user folder is in /Users/.\n\nYou will notice that there is a forward slash also before the name of the folder. That is because the /Users/ folder is a top folder, i.e. there are no folders further up in the hierarchy of folders.\nThis means that the full path for the big_data.csv file on a computer running macOS would be: /Users/ste/Downloads/big_data.csv.\n\nOn Windows: the user folder is in C:/Users/\n\nYou will notice that C is followed by a colon :. That is because C is a drive, which contains files and folders. C: is not contained by any other folder, i.e. there are no other folders above C: in the hierarchy of folders.\nThis means that the full path for the big_data.csv file on a Windows computer would be: C:/Users/ste/Downloads/big_data.csv.\n\n\nWhen a file path starts from a top-most folder, we call that path the absolute file path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute path\n\n\n\nAn absolute path is a file path that starts with a top-most folder.\n\n\nThere is another type of file paths, called relative paths. A relative path is a partial file path, relative to a specific folder. You will learn how to use relative paths below, when we will go through importing files in R using R scripts below.\nImporting files in R is very easy with the tidyverse packages. You just need to know the file type (very often the file extension helps) and the location of the file (i.e. the file path).\nThe next sections will teach you how to import data in R!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiz 1\n\n\n\nWhich of the following is an absolute paths?\n\n Downloads/courses/dal/data/ /Users/smruti/Downloads/data/files/ sascha/Documents/files_pdf/paper.pdf"

    "text": "2 Data types\n\n2.1 Tabular data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTabular data\n\n\n\nTabular data is data that has a form of a table: i.e. values structured in columns and rows.\n\n\nMost of the data we will be using in this course will be tabular and the files will be in the .csv format.\nThe comma separated values format (.csv) is the best format to save data in because it is basically a plain text file, it’s quick to parse, and can be opened and edited with any software (plus, it’s not a proprietary format).\nThis is what a .csv file looks like when you open it in a text editor (showing only the first few lines).\nGroup,ID,List,Target,ACC,RT,logRT,Critical_Filler,Word_Nonword,Relation_type,Branching\nL1,L1_01,A,banoshment,1,423,6.0474,Filler,Nonword,Phonological,NA\nL1,L1_01,A,unawareness,1,603,6.4019,Critical,Word,Unrelated,Left\nL1,L1_01,A,unholiness,1,739,6.6053,Critical,Word,Constituent,Left\nL1,L1_01,A,bictimize,1,510,6.2344,Filler,Nonword,Phonological,NA\nThe file contains tabular data (data that is structured as columns and rows, like a spreadsheet).\nTo separate the values of each column, a .csv file uses a comma , (hence the name “comma separated values”) to separate the values in every row.\nThe first line of the file indicates the names of the columns of the table:\nGroup,ID,List,Target,ACC,RT,logRT,Critical_Filler,Word_Nonword,Relation_type,Branching\nThere are 11 columns. The rest of the rows is the data, i.e. the values of each column separated by commas.\nL1,L1_01,A,banoshment,1,423,6.0474,Filler,Nonword,Phonological,NA\nL1,L1_01,A,unawareness,1,603,6.4019,Critical,Word,Unrelated,Left\nL1,L1_01,A,unholiness,1,739,6.6053,Critical,Word,Constituent,Left\nL1,L1_01,A,bictimize,1,510,6.2344,Filler,Nonword,Phonological,NA\nThis might look a bit confusing, but you will see later that, after importing this type of file, you can view it as a nice spreadsheet (as you would in Excel).\nAnother common type of tabular data file is spreadsheets, like spreadsheets created by Microsoft Excel or Apple Numbers. These are all proprietary formats that require you to have the software that were created with if you want to modify them.\nPortability and openness are important aspects of conducting ethical research, so that using open and non-proprietary file types makes your research more accessible and doesn’t privilege those who have access to specific software (remember, R is free!).\nThere are also variations of the comma separated values type, like tab separated values files (.tsv, which uses tab characters instead of commas) and fixed-width files (usually .txt, where columns are separated by as many white spaces as needed so that the columns align).\n\n\n2.2 Non-tabular data\nOf course, R can import also data that is not tabular, like map data and complex hierarchical data.\nWe will dip our toes in map data at the end of course, but virtually all of the data we will use will be tabular, just because that’s the format you need to do data visualisation and analyses.\n\n\n2.3 .rds files\nR has a special way of saving data: .rds files.\n.rds files allow you to save an R object to a file on your computer, so that you can read that file in when you need it.\nA common use for .rds files is to save tabular data that you have processed so that it can be readily used in many different scripts or even by other people.\nIn the following sections you will learn how to import (aka read) three types of data: .csv, Excel and .rds files."

    "text": "3 Import .csv files\nLet’s start with data from this paper: Song et al. 2020. Second language users exhibit shallow morphological processing. DOI: 10.1017/S0272263120000170.\nThe study consisted of a lexical decision task in which participants where first shown a prime, followed by a target word for which they had to indicate whether it was a real word or a nonce word.\nThe prime word belonged to one of three possible groups (Relation_type in the data) each of which refers to the morphological relation of the prime and the target word:\n\nUnrelated: for example, prolong (assuming unkindness as target, [[un-kind]-ness]).\nConstituent: unkind.\nNonConstituent: kindness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1 Download the data file\nPlease, follow these instructions carefully.\n\nDownload the file with the data by right-clicking on the following link and download the file: song2020-shallow.csv. (Note that tutorial files are also linked in the Course content page)\nCreate a folder called data/ (the slash is there just to remind you that it’s a folder, but you don’t have to include it in the name) in the RStudio project of the course.\n\nTo create a folder, go to the Files tab of the bottom-right panel in RStudio.\nMake sure you are viewing the project’s main folder.\nClick on the New Folder button, enter “data” in the text box and click OK\n\nMove the downloaded file into the data/ folder.\n\nOpen a Finder or File Explorer window.\nNavigate to the folder where you have saved the downloaded file (it will very likely be the Downloads/ folder).\nCopy the file.\nIn Finder or File Explorer, navigate to the RStudio project folder, then the data/ folder, and paste the file in there.\n\n\nThe rest of the tutorial will assume that you have created a folder called data/ in the Quarto project folder and that the files you download are in that folder.\nI recommend you to start being very organised with your files from now, whether it’s for this course or your dissertation or else. I also suggest to avoid overly nested structures (for example, avoid having one folder for each week for this course. Rather, save all data files in the data/ folder).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganising your files\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Open Science Framework has the following recommendations that apply very well to any type of research project.\n\nUse one folder per project. This will also be your RStudio project folder.\nSeparate raw data from derived data.\nSeparate code from data.\nMake raw data read-only.\n\nTo learn more about this, check the OSF page Organising files.\nIn brief, what these recommendations mean is that you want a folder for your research project/course/else, and inside the folder two folders: one for data and one for code.\nThe data/ folder could further contain raw/ for raw data (data that should not be lost or changed, for example collected data or annotations) and derived/ for data that derives from the raw data, for example through automated data processing.\nI usually also have a separate folder called figs/ or img/ where I save plots. Of course which folders you will have it’s ultimately up to you and needs will vary depending on the project and field!\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 The tidyverse packages\nImporting .csv files is very easy. You can use the read_csv() function from a collection of R packages known as the tidyverse.\nTo import data in R we will use the read_csv() function from the readr package, one of the tidyverse packages.\nInstalling the tidyverse packages is easy: you just need to install the tidyverse package and that will take care of installing the most important packages in the collection (called the “core” tidyverse packages).\nGo ahead and install the tidyverse from the Packages tab.1\n\n\n3.3 read_csv()\nThe read_csv() function from the readr package only requires you to specify the file path as a string (remember, strings are quoted between \" \", for example \"year_data.txt\"). On my computer, the file path of song2020-shallow.csv is /Users/ste/dal/data/song2020-shallow.csv, but on your computer the file path will be different, of course.\nAlso, note that it is not enough to use the read_csv() function. You also must assign the output of the read_csv() function (i.e. the data we are reading) to a variable, using the assignment arrow &lt;-, just like we were assigning values to variables in the previous weeks.\nAnd since the read_csv() is a function from the tidyverse, you first need to attach the tidyverse packages with library(tidyverse) (remember, you need to attach packages only once per session). This will attach the core tidyverse packages, including readr. Of course, you can also attach the individual packages directly: library(readr). If you use library(tidyverse) there is no need to attach individual tidyverse packages.\nBefore reading the data, create a new R script named tutorial_w03.R and save it in the code/ folder of your Quarto project.\nGenerally, you start the script with calls to library() to load all the packages you need for the script.\nNow we only need one package, tidyverse, but in most cases you will need more than one! The best practice is to attach all of packages first, in the top of your script. Please, get in the habit of doing this from now, so that you can keep your scripts tidy and pretty!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nPlease, don’t include install.packages() in your R scripts!\nRemember, you only have to install a package once, and you can just type it in the Console.\nBut DO include library() in your scripts.\n\n\nAt the top of tutorial_w03.R, write the following lines of code. Then run the code.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nsong2020 &lt;- read_csv(\"./data/song2020-shallow.csv\")\n\nRows: 6500 Columns: 11\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (8): Group, ID, List, Target, Critical_Filler, Word_Nonword, Relation_ty...\ndbl (3): ACC, RT, logRT\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nIf you look at the Environment tab, you will see song2020 under Data.\nBut wait, what is that \"./data/song2020-shallow.csv\"? That’s a relative path. We briefly mentioned relative paths above, but let’s understand the details now. You will be able to view the data soon.\n\n\n3.4 Relative paths\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative path\n\n\n\nA relative path is a file path that is relative to a folder, which is represented by ./\n\n\nWhen you are using R scripts in Quarto projects, the ./ folder paths are relative to is the project folder! This is true whichever the name of the folder/project and whichever it’s location on your computer.\nFor example, if your project it’s called awesome_proj and it’s in Downloads/stuff/, then if you write ./data/results.csv you really mean Downloads/stuff/awesome_proj/data/results.csv!\nHow does R know the path is relative to the project folder?\nThat is because when working with Quarto projects, all relative paths are relative to the project folder (i.e. the folder with the .Rproj file)!\nThe folder which relative paths are relative to is called the working directory (directory is just another way of saying folder).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking directory\n\n\n\nThe working directory is the folder which relative paths are relative to.\nWhen using RStudio projects, the working directory is the project folder.\n\n\nThe code read_csv(\"./data/song2020-shallow.csv\") above will work because you are using an RStudio project and inside the project folder there is a folder called data/ and in it there’s the song2020-shallow.csv file.\nSo from now on I encourage you to use Quarto projects, R scripts and relative paths always!\nThe benefit of doing so is that, if you move your project or rename it, or if you share the project with somebody, all the paths will just work because they are relative!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the working directory\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can get the current working directory with the getwd() command.\nRun it now in the Console! Is the returned path the project folder path?\nIf not, it might be that you are not working from a Quarto project. Check the top-right corner of RStudio: is the project name in there or do you see Project (none)?\nIf it’s the latter, you are not in a Quarto project, but you are running R from somewhere else (meaning, the working directory is somewhere else). If so, close RStudio and open the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5 View the data\nNow we can finally view the data.\nThe easiest way is to click on the name of the data listed in the Environment tab, in the top-right panel of RStudio.\nYou will see a nicely formatted table, as you would in a programme like Excel.\nData tables in R (i.e. tabular, spread-sheet like data) are called data frames or tibbles.2\nThe song2020 data frame contains 11 columns (called variables in the Environment tab). The 11 columns are the following:\n\nGroup: L1 vs L2 speakers of English.\nID: Subject unique ID.\nList: Word list (A to F).\nTarget: Target word in the lexical decision trial.\nACC: Lexical decision response accuracy (0 incorrect response, 1 correct response).\nRT: Reaction times of response in milliseconds.\nlogRT: Logged reaction times.\nCritical_Filler: Whether the trial was a filler or critical.\nWord_Nonword: Whether the Target was a real Word or a Nonword.\nRelation_type: The type of relation between prime and target word (Unrelated, NonCostituent, Constituent, Phonological).\nBranching: Constituent syntactic branching, Left and Right (shout out to Charlie Puth).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiz 3\n\n\n\nHow many rows does shallow have?\n\n 11 650 6500"

Write the following in the Console and press ENTER.\n\nmy_num\n\n[1] 156\n\n\nYou should see the value of my_num being printed in the console.\nA variable like my_num is called a numeric vector: i.e. a vector that contains a number (hence numeric).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVector\n\n\n\nA vector is an R object that contains one or more values of the same type.\n\n\nA vector is a type of variable and a numeric vector is a type of vector. However, it’s fine in most cases to use the word variable to mean vector (just note that a variable can also be something else than a vector; you will learn about other R objects from next week).\nLet’s now try some operations using variables.\n\nincome &lt;- 1200\nexpenses &lt;- 500\nincome - expenses\n\n[1] 700\n\n\nSee? You can use math operators with variables too!\nAnd you can also go all the way with variables.\n\nsavings &lt;- income - expenses\n\nNow check the value of savings…\n\nsavings\n\n[1] 700\n\n\nVectors can hold more than one item or value.\nJust use the combine c() function to create a vector containing multiple values.\nThe following are all numeric vectors.\n\na &lt;- 6\n# Vector with 2 values\nb &lt;- c(6, 8)\n# Vector with 3 values\nc &lt;- c(6, 8, 42)\n\n\nYou can check the type of vector (called class in R) with the class() function: for example, class(a) should return \"numeric\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumeric vector\n\n\n\nA numeric vector is a vector that holds one or more numeric values.\n\n\nNote that the following are the same:\n\na &lt;- 6\na\n\n[1] 6\n\nd &lt;- c(6)\nd\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nAnother important aspect of variables is that they are… variable! Meaning that once you assign a value to one variable, you can overwrite the value by assigning a new one to the same variable.\n\nmy_num &lt;- 88\nmy_num &lt;- 63\nmy_num\n\n[1] 63\n\n\nWhat if you want to know which variables you have created so far? Easy: use the ls() function. Just write ls() in the console and press ENTER: a list of existing variables will be returned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiz 3\n\n\n\nTrue or false?\n\nA vector is a type of variable. TRUEFALSE\nNot all variables are vectors. TRUEFALSE\nA numeric vector can only hold numeric values. TRUEFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Functions\n\nR cannot function without… functions.\n\nWe have encoutered a few functions: cat(), c(), class() and ls().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\n\n\n\nA function usually runs an operation on one or more specified arguments.\n\n\nA function in R has the form function() where:\n\nfunction is the name of the function, like cat.\n() are round parentheses, inside of which you write arguments, separated by commas.\n\nLet’s see an example with the function sum() (can you guess what it does?):\n\nsum(3, 5)\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nThe sum() function sums the numbers listed as arguments. Above, the arguments are 3 and 5.\nAnd of course arguments can be vectors!\n\nmy_nums &lt;- c(3, 5, 7)\n\nsum(my_nums)\n\n[1] 15\n\nmean(my_nums)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nSome functions work without specifying an argument, like ls().\nYou can also nest functions one inside the other: the output of the “lowest” function is used as the argument of the function above. Try and untangle the following.\n\ny &lt;- 10\nu &lt;- 6\ni &lt;- 7\no &lt;- 2\n\ncat(mean(c(sum(y, u), sum(i, o))))\n\n12.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiz 4\n\n\n\nTrue or false?\n\nYou can use functions within functions. TRUEFALSE\nAll function arguments must be specified. TRUEFALSE\nAll functions need at least one argument. TRUEFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra: R vs Python\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are familiar with Python, you will soon realise that R and Python, although they share many concepts and types of objects, they can differ substantially. This is because R is a functional programming language (based on functions) while Python is an Object Oriented programming language (based on methods applied on objects).\nGenerally speaking, functions look like print(x) while methods look like x.print()\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 String and logical vectors\n\nNot just numbers.\n\nWe have seen that variables can hold numeric vectors. But vectors are not restricted to being numeric. They can also store strings.\nA string is basically a set of characters (a word, a sentence, a full text).\nIn R, strings have to be quoted using double quotes \" \".\nChange the following strings to your name and surname. Remember to keep the double quotes\n\nname &lt;- \"Stefano\"\nsurname &lt;- \"Coretta\"\n\nname\n\n[1] \"Stefano\"\n\n\nStrings can be used as arguments in functions, like numbers can.\n\ncat(\"My name is\", name, surname)\n\nMy name is Stefano Coretta\n\n\nRemember that you can reuse the same variable name to override the variable value.\n\nname &lt;- \"Raj\"\n\ncat(\"My name is\", name, surname)\n\nMy name is Raj Coretta\n\n\nYou can combine multiple strings into a character vector, using c().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacter vector\n\n\n\nA character vector is a vector that holds one or more strings.\n\n\n\nfruit &lt;- c(\"apple\", \"oranges\", \"bananas\")\nfruit\n\n[1] \"apple\"   \"oranges\" \"bananas\"\n\n\nCheck the Environment tab. Character vectors have chr before the values.\nAnother type of vector is one that contains either TRUE or FALSE. Vectors of this type are called logical vectors and they are listed as logi in the Environment tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogical vector\n\n\n\nA logical vector is a vector that holds one or more TRUE or FALSE values.\n\n\n\ngroceries &lt;- c(\"apple\", \"flour\", \"margarine\", \"sugar\")\nin_pantry &lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)\n\ndata.frame(groceries, in_pantry)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nTRUE and FALSE values must be written in all capitals and without double quotes (they are not strings!).\n(We will talk about data frames, another type of object in R, in the following weeks.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiz 5\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the following is not a character vector.\n\n c(1, 2, \"43\") \"s\" c(apple) (assuming apple &lt;- 45) c(letters)\n\nWhich of the following is not a logical vector.\n\n c(T, T, F) TRUE \"FALSE\" c(FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the class() function to check the type (“class”) of a vector.\n\nclass(FALSE)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\nclass(c(1, 45))\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(c(\"a\", \"b\"))\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n\n5a\n\nc(1, 2, \"43\") is a character vector because the last number \"43\" is a string (it’s between double quotes!). A vector cannot have a mix of types of elements: they have to be all numbers or all strings or else, but not some numbers and some strings. Numbers are special in that if you include a number in a character vector without quoting it, it is automatically converted into a string. Try the following:\n\n\nchar &lt;- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\nchar &lt;- c(char, 1)\nchar\nclass(char)\n\n\nc(letters) is a character vector because letters contains the letters of the alphabet as strings (this vector comes with base R).\nc(apple) is not a character vector because the variable apple holds a number, 45!\n\n5b\n\n\"FALSE\" is not a logical vector because FALSE has been quoted (anything that is quoted is a string!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra: For-loops and if-else statements\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course does not cover programming in R in the strict sense, but if you are curious here’s a short primer on for-loops and if-else statements in R.\nFor-loops\n\nfruits &lt;- c(\"apples\", \"mangos\", \"durians\")\n\nfor (fruit in fruits) {\n  cat(\"I like\", fruit, \"\\n\")\n}\n\nI like apples \nI like mangos \nI like durians \n\n\nIf-else\n\nfor (fruit in fruits) {\n  if (grepl(\"n\", fruit)) {\n    cat(fruit, \"has an 'n'\", \"\\n\")\n  } else {\n    cat(fruit, \"does not have an 'n'\", \"\\n\")\n  }\n}\n\napples does not have an 'n' \nmangos has an 'n' \ndurians has an 'n'"

The main goal of the New Statistics is to shift the attention from statistical significance to estimation with quantification of uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk for help\n\n\n\nIf at any point during the course you don’t feel comfortable with any aspect of the course, you are unsure about anything that has been covered in class or in your own time, you are struggling to keep up with the course workload, you are experiencing mental of physical distress due to a pre-existing or new illness, medical condition or disability, or you find yourself unable to access basic needs like food or housing, please do get in touch with me and/or the PPLS support (go to the PPLS UG or MSc Hub on SharePoint &gt; Support for students &gt; Health & Wellbeing).\nWe are humans first and the rapidly-changing new world we are living in now can put us under pressure. What is most important to me is that you are first and foremost healthy and able to participate to the course, and that you succeed and get the most out of the course.\nIt is OK not to be OK, and remember that you are not alone.

The rubric is based on the learning outcomes of the course. For each criterion in the rubric there are three possible outcomes: insufficient, developing, proficient. This should help you identify areas of strength and those that can be improved.\nNote that the Feedback Categorisation Form is not used to calculate a numeric mark. Marking will follow the PPLS MSc Common Marking Scheme, which you can find here (login required).\nMore specifically, we will use a “step marking” procedure, where, within each mark band, you can get a 2, 5 or 8 (for example, 62, 65 or 68). We will not use other numbers within the scale. These are the criteria for getting 2, 5, or 8:\n\n2: The criteria for the mark band have been achieved, but there might be minor issues.\n5: The criteria for the mark band have been achieved fully.\n8: The criteria for the mark band have been achieved fully and in a particularly remarkable way, but not in such a way to grant a higher mark band.\n\nFinally, please note that marking does not follow a point-based system, i.e. different exercises are not assigned a specific amount of points you can obtain and we will instead adopt an “impression-based” marking system, based on the descriptors of the PPLS MSC Common Marking Scheme."

Run the following in the Console.\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"stan-dev/cmdstanr\")\ninstall.packages(c(\"brms\"))\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidybayes\", \"extraDistr\"))\nThe cmdstanr package is an interface between R and CmdStan (see below), while brms is the package you will use to run Bayesian linear models (think of it as the Bayesian equivalent of lme4).\nIt will take several minutes to install the packages, depending on your system and configuration.\nIf at any point you get asked about installing extra packages or software or update existing packages or software, please do so. In all cases, carefully read the message in the Console or in a pop-up window: they always tell you what to do or the options you have.\n\n\n2.3 Install CmdStan\nNow that you have installed the R packages, you need to install CmdStan.\nCmdStan is a shell interface to the programming language Stan.\nStan is what runs the Bayesian models, but you don’t have to know Stan, because you will use the R packages to run the models (those packages will communicate with Stan in your stead).\nTo install CmdStan, run the following command in the R console:\ncmdstanr::install_cmdstan(cores = parallel::detectCores(), overwrite = TRUE)\nIt will take several minutes and you will see a lot of text flashing in the Console.\n\n\n2.4 Check your installation\nRun the following in the RStudio Console.\nlibrary(cmdstanr)\nfile &lt;- file.path(cmdstan_path(), \"examples\", \"bernoulli\", \"bernoulli.stan\")\nmod &lt;- cmdstan_model(file, force_recompile = TRUE)\ndata_list &lt;- list(N = 10, y = c(0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1))\nfit &lt;- mod$sample(\n  data = data_list, \n  seed = 123, \n  chains = 4, \n  parallel_chains = 4,\n  refresh = 500 # print update every 500 iters\n)\nIf everything goes well you should see Compiling Stan program… and then Running MCMC with 4 parallel chains… followed by information on chains and iterations."

We will use these in this course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto Projects\n\n\n\nA Quarto Project is an RStudio project which has a _quarto.yml file.\n\n\nYou will learn a bit more about the _quarto.yml file below.\nYou can create as many Quarto Projects as you wish, and I recommend to create one per project (your dissertation, a research project, a course, etc…). Also, I strongly recommend that you DO NOT save projects on One Drive. This is known to cause issues, so it is best to save projects on your Documents folder, for example.\nWe will create a Quarto Project for this course (meaning, you will create a folder for the course which will be the Quarto Project). You will have to use this project/folder throughout the semester.\nTo create a new Quarto Project, click on the button that looks like a transparent light blue box with a plus, in the top-left corner of RStudio. A window like the one below will pop up.\n\nClick on New Directory then Quarto Project.\n\nNow, this will create a new folder (aka directory) on your computer and will make that an RStudio Project (meaning, it will add a file with the .Rproj extension to the folder; the name of the file will be the name of the project/folder).\nGive a name to your new project, something like the name of the course and year (e.g. dal-2024).\nThen you need to specify where to create this new folder/Project. Click on Browse… and navigate to the folder you want to create the new folder/Project in. DO NOT use One Drive, as mentioned above.\nWhen done, click on Create Project. RStudio will automatically open your new project.\n\nThe project folder will contain the following files:\n\nA _quarto.yml file, that tells RStudio this is a Quarto Project.\nA .qmd file, named after the name of project. You will learn about .qmd files next week.\nAn .rproj file, named after the name of the project. This file is there just to inform RStudio that this folder is a project and you are not supposed to edit it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen working through these tutorials, always make sure you are in the course’s RStudio Quarto Project you created.\nYou know you are in an RStudio Project because you can see the name of the Project in the top-right corner of RStudio, next to the light blue cube icon.\nIf you see Project (none) in the top-right corner, that means your are not in an RStudio Project.\nTo make sure you are in the RStudio project, to open the project go to the project folder in File Explorer or Finder and double click on the .Rproj file.\n\n\nThere are several ways of opening an RStudio Project:\n\nYou can go to the RStudio Project folder in Finder or File Explorer and double click on the .Rproj file.\nYou can click on File &gt; Open Project in the RStudio menu.\nYou can click on the project name in the top-right corner of RStudio, which will bring up a list of projects. Click on the desired project to open it.\n\n\n\n2.2 A few important settings\nBefore moving on, there are a few important settings that you need to change. See figure below for how they should look.\n\n\nOpen the RStudio preferences (Tools &gt; Global options..., might be different on Windows).\nUn-tick Restore .RData into workspace at startup.\n\nThis mean that every time you start RStudio you are working with a clean Environment. Not restoring the workspace ensures that the code you write is fully reproducible.\n\nSelect Never in Save workspace to .RData on exit.\n\nSince we are not restoring the workspace at start-up, we don’t need to save it. Remember that as long as you save the code, you will not lose any of your work! You will learn how to save code below.\n\nClick OK to confirm the changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiz 1\n\n\n\nTrue or false?\n\nRStudio executes the code. TRUEFALSE\nR is a programming language. TRUEFALSE\nAn IDE is necessary to run R. TRUEFALSE\nRStudio projects are folders with an .Rproj file. TRUEFALSE\nThe project name is shown in the top-right corner of RStudio. TRUEFALSE"

    "text": "4 R scripts\nSo far, you’ve been asked to write code in the Console and run it there.\nBut this is not very efficient. Every time, you need to write the code and execute it in the right order and it quickly becomes very difficult to keep track of everything when things start getting more involved.\nA solution is to use R scripts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR script\n\n\n\nAn R script is a file with the .R extension that contains R code.\n\n\nFor the rest of this tutorial, you will write all code in an R script.\n\n4.1 Create an R script\nFirst, create a folder called code in your project folder. You can do so from withint RStudio, in the Files tab or you can just create the folder in the File Explorer/Finder. This will be the folder where you will save all of your R scripts and other code files.\nNow, to create a new R script, look at the top-left corner of RStudio: the first button to the left looks like a white sheet with a green plus sign. This is the New file button. Click on that and you will see a few options to create a new file.\nClick on R Script. A new empty R script will be created and will open in the File Editor window of RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNote that creating an R script does not automatically saves it on your computer. To do so, either use the keyboard short-cut CMD+S/CTRL+S or click on the floppy disk icon in the menu below the file tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the file inside the code/ folder with the following name: tutorial-w02.R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nRemember that all the files of your RStudio project don’t live inside RStudio but on your computer.\nSo you can always access them from the Finder or File Explorer! However, do not open a file by double clicking on it from the Finder/File Explorer.\nRather, open the RStudio project by double clicking on the .Rproj file and then open files from RStudio to ensure you are working within the RStudio project and the working directory is set correctly. (See the tutorial from Week 1).\n\n\nNow your script is ready to be filled with code. Copy the following lines of code and paste them at the top of your R script (this is the same code as above).\n\napples &lt;- 10\noranges &lt;- 6\ndurians &lt;- 2\n\nfruit_n &lt;- sum(apples, oranges, durians)\ncat(\"We have in total\", fruit_n, \"fruits.\")\n\nwords &lt;- c(\"gold\", \"nice\", \"up\", \"of\")\nlength(words)\n\n\n\n4.2 Run code\nNow, there are several ways to run code.\nOne is to click on the Run button. You can find this in the top-right corner of the script window.\n\nWhen you click Run, R runs the line of code that currently has the text cursor (|) and then moves the cursor to the next line (you can click Run again to run the line and so on.) You can also select multiple lines on the script and click Run, and all the selected lines will be run.\nAn alternative way is to place the text cursor on the line of code you want to run and then press CMD+ENTER/CTRL+ENTER. This will run the line of code and move the text cursor to the next line of code, as if you had clicked Run.\nYou can even select multiple lines of code (as you would select text) and press CMD+ENTER/CTRL+ENTER to run multiple lines of code!\nNow that you know how to use R scripts and run code in them, I will assume that you will keep writing new code from this tutorial in your script and run it from there!\nIn the next section, you will learn how to extend R capabilities with packages."

    "text": "5 R packages\nWhen you install R, a library of packages is also installed. Packages provide R with extra functionalities, usually by making extra functions available for use. You can think of packages as “plug-ins” that you install once and then you can “activate” them when you need them. The library installed with R contains a set of packages that are collectively known as the base R packages, but you can install more any time!\nNote that the R library is a folder on your computer. Packages are not installed inside RStudio. Remember that RStudio is just an interface.\nYou can check all of the currently installed packages in the bottom-right panel of RStudio, in the Packages tab. There you can also install new packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR library and packages\n\n\n\n\nThe R library contains the base R packages and all the user-installed packages.\nR packages provide R with extra functionalities and are installed into the R library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra: Where is my R library?\n\n\n\nIf you want to find the path of the R library on your computer, type .libPaths() in the Console. The function returns (i.e. outputs) the path or paths where your R library is.\n\n\n\n5.0.1 Install packages\nYou can install extra packages in the R library in two ways:\n\nYou can use the install.packages() function. This function takes the name of the package you want to install as a string, for example install.packages(\"cowsay\")\nOr you can go the Packages tab in the bottom-right panel of RStudio and click on Install. A small window will pop up. See the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo ahead and try to install a package using the second method. Install the cowsay and the fortunes packages (see picture above for how to write the packages). After installing you will see that the package fortunes is listed in the Packages tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall packages\n\n\n\nTo install packages, fo to the Packages tab of the bottom-right panel of RStudio and click on Install.\nIn the “Install packages” window, list the package names and then click Install.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou need to install a package ONLY ONCE! Once installed, it’s there for ever, saved in the R library. You will be able to use all of your installed packages in any RStudio project you create.\n\n\n\n\n5.0.2 Attach packages\nNow, to use a package you need to attach the package to the current R session with the library() function. Attaching a package makes the functions that come with the package available to us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou need to attach the packages you want to use once per R session.\nNote that every time you open RStudio, a new R session is started.\n\n\nLet’s attach the cowsay and fortunes packages. Write the following code at the top of your R script, before all the other code you wrote.\n\nlibrary(cowsay)\nlibrary(fortunes)\n\nNote that library(cowsay) takes the name of the package without quotes, although if you put the name in quotes it also works. You need one library() function per package (there are other ways, but we will stick with this one).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttaching packages\n\n\n\nPackages are attached with the library(pkg.name) function, where pkg.name is the name of the package.\nIt is customary to put all the packages used in the script at the top of the script.\n\n\nNow you can use the functions provided by the attached packages. Try out the say() function from the cowsay package.\nWrite the following in your R script and run it!\n\nsay(\"hot diggity\", \"frog\")\n\n(I know, the usefulness of the package might be questionable, but it is fun!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nRemember, you need to install a package only once but you need to attach it with library() every time you start R.\nThink of install.packages() as mounting a light bulb (installing the package) and library() as the light switch (attaching the package).\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Package documentation\nTo learn what a function does, you can check its documentation by typing in the Console the function name preceded by a ? question mark. Type ?say in the Console and hit ENTER to see the function documentation. You should see something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Description section is usually a brief explanation of what the function does.\nIn the Usage section, the usage of the function is shown by showing which arguments the function has and which default values (if any) each argument has. When the argument does not have a default value, NULL is listed as the value.\nThe Arguments section gives a thorough explanation of each function argument. (Ignore … for now).\nHow many arguments does say() have? How many arguments have a default value?\nDefault argument values allow you to use the function without specifying those arguments. Just write say() in your script on a new line and run it. Does the output make sense based on the Usage section of the documentation?\nThe rest of the function documentation usually has further details, which are followed by Examples. It is always a good idea to look at the example and test them in the Console when learning new functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiz 2\n\n\n\nWhich of the following statements is wrong?\n\n You attach libraries with library(). install.packages() does not load packages. The R library is a folder."

Comments are simply skipped when R runs code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\nYou can add text comments in R scripts by starting a new line with # or by writing text preceded by # at the end of any line of code.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n# This is a comment.

    "text": "Last week, you learnt how to use R scripts to save your code.\nKeeping track of the code you use for data analysis is a very important aspect of research project managing: not only the code is there if you need to rerun it later, but it allows your data analysis to be reproducible (i.e., it can be reproduced by you or other people in such a way that starting with the same data and code you get to the same results).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducible research\n\n\n\nResearch is reproducible when the same data and same code return the same results.\n\n\nR scripts are great for writing code, and you can even document the code (add explanations or notes) with comments (i.e. lines that start with #).\nBut for longer text or complex data analysis reports, R scripts can be a bit cumbersome.\nA solution to this is using Quarto files (they have the .qmd extension).\n\n\nQuarto is a file format that allows you to mix code and formatted text in the same file.\nThis means that you can write dynamic reports using Quarto files: dynamic reports are just like analysis reports (i.e. they include formatted text, plots, tables, code output, code, etc…) but they are dynamic in the sense that if, for example, data or code changes, you can just rerun the report Rmd file and all code output (plots, tables, etc…) is updated accordingly!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamic reports in Quarto\n\n\n\nQuarto is a file type with extension .Rmd in which you can write formatted text and code together.\nQuarto can be used to generate dynamic reports: these are files that are generated automatically from the file source, ensuring data and results in the report are always up to date.\n\n\n\n\n\nR comments in R scripts cannot be formatted (for example, you can’t make bold or italic texts).\nText in Quarto files can be fully formatted using a simple but powerful mark-up language called markdown.\nYou don’t have to learn markdown all in one go, so I encourage you to just learn it bit by bit, at your pace. You can look at the the Markdown Guide for an in-depth intro and/or dive in the Markdown Tutorial for a hands-on approach.\nA few quick pointers (you can test them in the Markdown Live Preview):\n\nText can be made italics by enclosing it between single stars: *this text is in italics*.\nYou can make text bold with two stars: **this text is bold!**.\nHeadings are created with #: # This is a level-1 heading. ## This is a level-2 heading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark-up, Markdown\n\n\n\nA mark-up language is a text-formatting system consisting of symbols or keywords that control the structure, formatting or relationships of textual elements. The most common mark-up languages are HTML, XML and TeX.\nMarkdown is a simple yet powerful mark-up language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen working through these tutorials, always make sure you are in the course Quarto Project you just created.\nYou know you are in a Quarto Project because you can see the name of the Project in the top-right corner of RStudio, next to the light-blue cube icon.\nIf you see Project (none) in the top-right corner, that means you are not in the Quarto Project.\nTo make sure you are in the Quarto project, you can open the project by going to the project folder in File Explorer (Win) or Finder (macOS) and double click on the .Rproj file.\n\n\nTo create a new .qmd file, just click on the New file button, then Quarto Document.... (If you are asked to install/update packages, do so.)\n\n\n\n\n\nA window will open. Add a title of your choice and your name. Make sure the Use visual markdown editor is NOT ticked, then click OK (you will be free to use the visual editor later, but it is important that you first see what a Quarto document looks like under the hood first).\n\n\n\n\n\nA new .qmd file will be created and will open in the File Editor panel in RStudio.\nNote that creating a Quarto file does not automatically saves it on your computer. To do so, either use the keyboard short-cut CMD+S/CTRL+S or click on the floppy disk icon in the menu below the file tab.\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the file inside the code/ folder with the following name: tutorial-w04.qmd.\nRemember that all the files of your RStudio project don’t live inside RStudio but on your computer.\n\n\n\nA Quarto file usually has three main parts:\n\nThe YAML header (green).\nCode chunks (red).\nText (blue).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach Quarto file has to start with a YAML header, but you can include as many code chunks and as much text as you wish, in any order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto: YAML header\n\n\n\nThe header of a .qmd file contains a list of key: value pairs, used to specify settings or document info like the title and author.\nYAML headers start and end with three dashes ---.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto: Code chunks\n\n\n\nCode chunks start and end with three back-ticks ``` and they contain code.\n{r} indicates that the code is R code. Settings can be specified inside the chunk with the #| prefix: for example #| label: setup sets the name of the chunk (the label) to setup.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using Quarto projects, the working directory (the directory all relative paths are relative to) is the project folder.\nHowever, when running code from a Quarto file, the code is run as if the working directory were the folder in which the file is saved.\nThis isn’t an issue if the Quarto file is directly in the project folder, but in our case our Quarto files live in the code/ folder within the project folder (and it is good practice to do so!).\nWe can instruct R to •always* run code from the project folder (i.e. the working directory is the project folder). This is when the _quarto.yml file comes into play.\nOpen the _quarto.yml file in RStudio (you can simply click on the file in the Files tab and that will open the file in the RStudio editor. Add the line execute-dir: project under the title. Note that indentation should be respected, so the line you write should align with title:, not with project:.\nproject:\n  title: \"dal\"\n  execute-dir: project\nNow, all code in Quarto files, no matter where they are saved, will be run with the project folder as the working directory.\n\n\n\nYou will use the Quarto document you created to write text and code for this tutorial.\nThis is what the Quarto document should look like now:\n\n\n\n\n\nNow add an empty line and in the following line write a second-level heading ## Attach packages, followed by two empty lines. Like so:\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can insert a code chunk to add the code to attach the tidyverse. To insert a new code chunk, you can click on the Insert a new code chunk button (the little green square icon with a C and a plus) , or you can press OPT+CMD+I/ALT+CTRL+I.\n\n\n\n\n\nA new R code chunk will be inserted at the text cursor position.\nNow go ahead and add the following lines of code inside the R code chunk.\n#| label: setup\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning code in Quarto documents\n\n\n\nTo run the code, you have two options:\n\nYou click the small green triangle in the top-right corner of the chunk. This runs all the code in the code chunk.\nEnsure the text cursor is inside the code chunk and press SHIFT+CMD+ENTER/SHIFT+CTRL+ENTER. This too runs all the code in the code chunk.\n\nIf you want to run line by line in the code chunk, you can place the text cursor on the line you want to run and press CMD+ENTER/CTRL+ENTER. The current line is run nd the text cursor is moved to the next line.\n\n\nRun the setup chunk now.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see messages printed below the code chunk, in your Quarto file (don’t worry about the Conflicts, they just tell you that some functions from the tidyverse packages have replaced the base R functions, which is OK).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice 1\n\n\n\nTry this yourself:\n\nCreate a new second-level heading (with ##) called Read data.\nCreate a new R code chunk.\nSet the label of the chunk to read-data.\nAdd code to read the following files:\n\ncameron2020-gestures.csv\nglot_status.rds\n\nRun the code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can render a .qmd file into a nicely formatted HTML file.\nTo render a Quarto file, just click on the Render button and an HTML file will be created and saved in the same location of the Quarto file.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will also be shown in the Viewer pane (like in the picture below) or in a new window (you can set this option in the RStudio Preferences &gt; R Markdown &gt; Basics &gt; Show output preview in…).\n\n\n\n\n\nRendering Quarto files is not restricted to HTML, but also PDFs and even Word documents!\nThis is very handy when you are writing an analysis report you need to share with others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto: Rendering\n\n\n\nQuarto files can be rendered into other formats, like HTML, PDF and Word documents.\n\n\nThe assessments of this course will require you to write text and code in a Quarto file and render it to PDF.\nYou could even write your dissertation in Quarto!\nThe following sections will introduce you to the basics of plotting data. You will keep learning how to create plots throughout the course."

    "text": "Last week, you learnt how to use R scripts to save your code.\nKeeping track of the code you use for data analysis is a very important aspect of research project managing: not only the code is there if you need to rerun it later, but it allows your data analysis to be reproducible (i.e., it can be reproduced by you or other people in such a way that starting with the same data and code you get to the same results).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducible research\n\n\n\nResearch is reproducible when the same data and same code return the same results.\n\n\nR scripts are great for writing code, and you can even document the code (add explanations or notes) with comments (i.e. lines that start with #).\nBut for longer text or complex data analysis reports, R scripts can be a bit cumbersome.\nA solution to this is using Quarto files (they have the .qmd extension).\n\n\nQuarto is a file format that allows you to mix code and formatted text in the same file.\nThis means that you can write dynamic reports using Quarto files: dynamic reports are just like analysis reports (i.e. they include formatted text, plots, tables, code output, code, etc…) but they are dynamic in the sense that if, for example, data or code changes, you can just rerun the report Rmd file and all code output (plots, tables, etc…) is updated accordingly!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamic reports in Quarto\n\n\n\nQuarto is a file type with extension .Rmd in which you can write formatted text and code together.\nQuarto can be used to generate dynamic reports: these are files that are generated automatically from the file source, ensuring data and results in the report are always up to date.\n\n\n\n\n\nR comments in R scripts cannot be formatted (for example, you can’t make bold or italic texts).\nText in Quarto files can be fully formatted using a simple but powerful mark-up language called markdown.\nYou don’t have to learn markdown all in one go, so I encourage you to just learn it bit by bit, at your pace. You can look at the the Markdown Guide for an in-depth intro and/or dive in the Markdown Tutorial for a hands-on approach.\nA few quick pointers (you can test them in the Markdown Live Preview):\n\nText can be made italics by enclosing it between single stars: *this text is in italics*.\nYou can make text bold with two stars: **this text is bold!**.\nHeadings are created with #: # This is a level-1 heading. ## This is a level-2 heading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark-up, Markdown\n\n\n\nA mark-up language is a text-formatting system consisting of symbols or keywords that control the structure, formatting or relationships of textual elements. The most common mark-up languages are HTML, XML and TeX.\nMarkdown is a simple yet powerful mark-up language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen working through these tutorials, always make sure you are in the course Quarto Project you just created.\nYou know you are in a Quarto Project because you can see the name of the Project in the top-right corner of RStudio, next to the light-blue cube icon.\nIf you see Project (none) in the top-right corner, that means you are not in the Quarto Project.\nTo make sure you are in the Quarto project, you can open the project by going to the project folder in File Explorer (Win) or Finder (macOS) and double click on the .Rproj file.\n\n\nTo create a new .qmd file, just click on the New file button, then Quarto Document.... (If you are asked to install/update packages, do so.)\n\n\n\n\n\nA window will open. Add a title of your choice and your name. Make sure the Use visual markdown editor is NOT ticked, then click OK (you will be free to use the visual editor later, but it is important that you first see what a Quarto document looks like under the hood first).\n\n\n\n\n\nA new .qmd file will be created and will open in the File Editor panel in RStudio.\nNote that creating a Quarto file does not automatically saves it on your computer. To do so, either use the keyboard short-cut CMD+S/CTRL+S or click on the floppy disk icon in the menu below the file tab.\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the file inside the code/ folder with the following name: tutorial-w04.qmd.\nRemember that all the files of your RStudio project don’t live inside RStudio but on your computer.\n\n\n\nA Quarto file usually has three main parts:\n\nThe YAML header (green).\nCode chunks (red).\nText (blue).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach Quarto file has to start with a YAML header, but you can include as many code chunks and as much text as you wish, in any order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto: YAML header\n\n\n\nThe header of a .qmd file contains a list of key: value pairs, used to specify settings or document info like the title and author.\nYAML headers start and end with three dashes ---.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto: Code chunks\n\n\n\nCode chunks start and end with three back-ticks ``` and they contain code.\n{r} indicates that the code is R code. Settings can be specified inside the chunk with the #| prefix: for example #| label: setup sets the name of the chunk (the label) to setup.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using Quarto projects, the working directory (the directory all relative paths are relative to) is the project folder.\nHowever, when running code from a Quarto file, the code is run as if the working directory were the folder in which the file is saved.\nThis isn’t an issue if the Quarto file is directly in the project folder, but in our case our Quarto files live in the code/ folder within the project folder (and it is good practice to do so!).\nWe can instruct R to •always* run code from the project folder (i.e. the working directory is the project folder). This is when the _quarto.yml file comes into play.\nOpen the _quarto.yml file in RStudio (you can simply click on the file in the Files tab and that will open the file in the RStudio editor. Add the line execute-dir: project under the title. Note that indentation should be respected, so the line you write should align with title:, not with project:.\nproject:\n  title: \"dal\"\n  execute-dir: project\nNow, all code in Quarto files, no matter where they are saved, will be run with the project folder as the working directory.\n\n\n\nYou will use the Quarto document you created to write text and code for this tutorial.\nThis is what the Quarto document should look like now:\n\n\n\n\n\nNow add an empty line and in the following line write a second-level heading ## Attach packages, followed by two empty lines. Like so:\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can insert a code chunk to add the code to attach the tidyverse. To insert a new code chunk, you can click on the Insert a new code chunk button (the little green square icon with a C and a plus) , or you can press OPT+CMD+I/ALT+CTRL+I.\n\n\n\n\n\nA new R code chunk will be inserted at the text cursor position.\nNow go ahead and add the following lines of code inside the R code chunk.\n#| label: setup\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning code in Quarto documents\n\n\n\nTo run the code, you have two options:\n\nYou click the small green triangle in the top-right corner of the chunk. This runs all the code in the code chunk.\nEnsure the text cursor is inside the code chunk and press SHIFT+CMD+ENTER/SHIFT+CTRL+ENTER. This too runs all the code in the code chunk.\n\nIf you want to run line by line in the code chunk, you can place the text cursor on the line you want to run and press CMD+ENTER/CTRL+ENTER. The current line is run nd the text cursor is moved to the next line.\n\n\nRun the setup chunk now.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see messages printed below the code chunk, in your Quarto file (don’t worry about the Conflicts, they just tell you that some functions from the tidyverse packages have replaced the base R functions, which is OK).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice 1\n\n\n\nTry this yourself:\n\nCreate a new second-level heading (with ##) called Read data.\nCreate a new R code chunk.\nSet the label of the chunk to read-data.\nAdd code to read the following files:\n\ncameron2020-gestures.csv\nglot_status.rds\n\nRun the code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can render a .qmd file into a nicely formatted HTML file.\nTo render a Quarto file, just click on the Render button and an HTML file will be created and saved in the same location of the Quarto file.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will also be shown in the Viewer pane (like in the picture below) or in a new window (you can set this option in the RStudio Preferences &gt; R Markdown &gt; Basics &gt; Show output preview in…).\n\n\n\n\n\nRendering Quarto files is not restricted to HTML, but also PDFs and even Word documents!\nThis is very handy when you are writing an analysis report you need to share with others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto: Rendering\n\n\n\nQuarto files can be rendered into other formats, like HTML, PDF and Word documents.\n\n\nThe assessments of this course will require you to write text and code in a Quarto file and render it to PDF.\nYou could even write your dissertation in Quarto!\nThe following sections will introduce you to the basics of plotting data. You will keep learning how to create plots throughout the course."

    "text": "3 Your first ggplot2 plot\nThe tidyverse package ggplot2 provides users with a consistent set of functions to create captivating graphics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nTo be able to use the functions in a package, you first need to attach the package. We have already attached the library(tidyverse) packages, among which there is ggplot2, so you don’t need to do anything else.\n\n\n\n3.1 The polite data\nWe will use the polite data to learn the basics of plotting using ggplot.\nThe data comes from the paper by Winter and Grawunder, 2020. The phonetic profile of Korean formal and informal speech registers. DOI: 10.1016/j.wocn.2012.08.006. Read the abstract to familiarise yourself with the study.\nTo download the file with the data right-click on the following link and download the file: polite.csv. (Note that tutorial files are also linked in Course content). Remember to save the file in data/ in the course project folder.\nWith Rmd files, we can use relative paths to read data. For relative paths to work relative to the project working directory, you need to install the here package (remember how to install packages?) and add the following line in the setup chunk, just after the first line of code.\nknitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = here::here())\n(Note that it’s knitr::opts_knit rather than knitr::opts_chunk).\nNow rerun the setup code chunk to set the new option.\nThis will set the working directory for the Rmd file to the project working directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nMake sure that you always include that knitr::opts_knit() line in the setup block, or R might get confused about where the working directory is and not be able to find the data.\n\n\nFinally, create a new code chunk, add the following line of code and then run the code chunk to read the data.\n\npolite &lt;- read_csv(\"data/polite.csv\")\n\nIn this tutorial we will use the following columns:\n\nf0mn: mean f0 (fundamental frequency).\nH1H2: difference between H2 and H1 (second and first harmonic).\ngender: speaker’s gender.\nmusicstudent: whether the speaker is a music student (yes) or not (no).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiz 1\n\n\n\nWhat does here::here() return?\n\n The current working directory. The project directory. The data directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer The current working directory. is wrong because if you manually set the working directory with setwd(), here::here() will still return the project directory!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 A basic plot\nThese are the minimum constituents of a ggplot2 plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot basics\n\n\n\n\nThe data: you have to specify the data frame with the data you want to plot.\nThe mapping: the mapping tells ggplot how to map data columns to parts of the plot like the axes or groupings within the data. These parts are called aesthetics, or aes for short.\n\n\n\nYou can specify the data and mapping with the data and mapping arguments of the ggplot() function.\nNote that the mapping argument is always specified with aes(): mapping = aes(…).\nIn the following bare plot, we are just mapping the mean f0 (f0) to the x-axis and the H2-H1 difference to the y-axis, from the polite data frame.\nCreate a new code chunk, copy the following code and run it. From this point on I will assume you’ll create a new code chunk and run the code yourself, without explicit instructions.\n\nggplot(\n  data = polite,\n  mapping = aes(x = f0mn, y = H1H2)\n)\n\n\n\n\nNot much to see here: just two axes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiz 2\n\n\n\nIs the following code correct? Justify your answer. TRUEFALSE\nggplot(\n  data = polite,\n  mapping = c(x = total_duration, y = articulation_rate)\n)\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Let’s add geometries\nNice, but we are missing the most important part: showing the data!\nData is represented with geometries, or geoms for short. geoms are added to the base ggplot with functions whose names all start with geom_.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometries\n\n\n\nGeometries are plot elements that show the data through geometric shapes.\nDifferent geometries are added to a ggplot using one of the geom_*() functions.\n\n\nFor this plot, you want to use geom_point(). This geom simply adds point to the plot based on the data in the polite data frame.\nTo add geoms to a plot, you write a + at the end of the ggplot() command and include the geom on the next line. For example:\n\nggplot(\n  data = polite,\n  mapping = aes(x = f0mn, y = H1H2)\n) +\n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 12 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis type of plot, with two continuous axes and data represented by points, is called a scatter plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScatter plot\n\n\n\nA scatter plot is a plot with two numeric axes and points indicating the data. It is used when you want to show the relationship between two numeric variables.\nTo create a scatter plot, use the geom_point() geometry.\n\n\nWhen writing your results section, you could describe the plot this way:\n\nFigure 1 shows a scatter plot of mean f0 on the x-axis and H1-H2 difference on the y-axis. The plot suggest an overall negative relationship between mean f0 and H1-H2 difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNote that using the + is a quirk of ggplot(). The idea behind it is that you start from a bare plot and you add (+) layers of data on top of it. This is because of the philosophy behind the package, called the Layered Grammar of Graphics.\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Function arguments\nNote that the data and mapping arguments don’t have to be named explicitly (with data = and mapping =) in the ggplot() function, since they are obligatory and they are specified in that order.\n\nggplot(\n  polite,\n  aes(x = f0mn, y = H1H2)\n) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, you can also leave out x = and y =.\n\nggplot(\n  polite,\n  aes(f0mn, H1H2)\n) +\n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 12 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nTry running ?ggplot in the Console to see the arguments of the function and the order they appear in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiz 3\n\n\n\nWhich of the following will produce the same plot as the one above? Reason through it first without running the code, then run all of these to check whether they look the way you expected.\n\n ggplot(polite, aes(H1H2, f0mn)) + geom_point() ggplot(polite, aes(y = H1H2, x = f0mn)) + geom_point() ggplot(polite, aes(y = f0mn, x = H1H2)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen specifying arguments, the order matters when not using the argument names.\nSo this aes(a, b) is different from aes(b, a).\nBut this aes(y = b, x = a) is the same as aes(a, b)."

    "section": "4 Bar charts",
    "text": "4 Bar charts\nAnother common type of plot is the bar chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBar charts\n\n\n\nBar charts are useful when you are counting things. For example:\n\nNumber of verbs vs nouns vs adjectives in a corpus.\nNumber of languages by geographic area.\nNumber of correct vs incorrect responses.\n\nThe bar chart geometry is geom_bar().\n\n\nIn the following example, we will be counting the number of languages by their endangerment status.\n\n4.1 Do you understand me?\nThere are thousands of languages in the world, but most of them are losing speakers, and some are already no longer spoken. The endangerment status of a language in the data is on a scale from not endangered (languages with large populations of speakers) through threatened, shifting and nearly extinct, to extinct (languages that have no living speakers left).\nThe glot_status data frame contains the endangerment status for 7,845 languages from Glottolog. To download the file with the data right-click on the following link and download the file: glot_status.rds. (Note that tutorial files are also linked in the Syllabus). Remember to save the file in data/ in the course project folder.\nThis time the file is not a .csv file but an .rds file. .rds files are files that can save any R object. They are commonly used to save data frames, like in this case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRds files\n\n\n\n.Rds files are a type of R file which can store any R object and save it on disk.\nR objects can be saved to an .Rds file with the saveRDS() function and they can be read with the readRDS() function.\n\n\nTo read an .rds file you need the readRDS() function.\n\nglot_status &lt;- readRDS(\"data/glot_status.rds\")\n\nHere’s what the data frame looks like.\n\nglot_status\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nFor us today, the relevant columns are:\n\nName: the language name.\nstatus: the endangerment status of the language.\nMacroarea: the geographic macro-area the language is spoken in.\n\n\n\n4.2 Create a bar chart\nTo create a bar chart, use the geom_bar() geometry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBar chart axes\n\n\n\nIn a simple bar chart, you only need to specify one axis, the x-axis, in the aesthetics aes().\nThis is because the counts that are placed on the y-axis are calculated by the geom_bar() function under the hood.\nThis quirk is something that confuses many new learners, so make sure you internalise this.\n\n\nGo ahead and complete the following code to create a bar chart.\n\nglot_status %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = status)) +\n  ...\n\nNote how we’re using %&gt;% to pipe the glot_status data frame into the ggplot() function. This works because ggplot()’s first argument is the data, and piping is a different way of providing the first argument to a function.\nAs mentioned above, the counting for the y-axis is done automatically. R looks in the status column and counts how many times each value in the column occurs in the data frame.\nIf you did things correctly, you should get the following plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nA description of the plot:\n\nThe number of languages by endangered status is shown as a bar chart in Figure 2. Among the languages that are endangered, excluding those that are extinct, the majority are either threatened or shifting.\n\n\n\n4.3 Stacked bar charts\nA special type of bar charts are the so-called stacked bar charts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStacked bar chart\n\n\n\nA stacked bar chart is a bar chart in which each contains a “stack” of shorter bars, each indicating the counts of some sub-groups.\nThis type of plot is useful to show how counts of something vary depending on some other grouping (in other words, when you want to count the occurrences of a categorical variable based on another categorical variable). For example:\n\nNumber of languages by endangerment status, grouped by geographic area.\nNumber of infants by head-turning preference, grouped by first language.\nNumber of past vs non-past verbs, grouped by verb class.\n\n\n\nTo create a stacked bar chart, you just need to add a new aesthetic mapping to aes(): fill. The fill aesthetic lets you fill bars or areas with different colours depending on the values of a specified column.\nLet’s make a plot on language endangerment by macro-area.\nComplete the following code by specifying that fill should be based on status.\n\nggplot(\n  glot_status,\n  aes(x = Macroarea, ...)\n) +\n  geom_bar()\n\nYou should get the following.\n\n\n\n\n\nA write-up example:\n\nFigure 3 shows the number of languages by geographic macroarea, subdivided by endangerment status. Africa, Eurasia and Papunesia have substantially more languages than the other areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiz 4\n\n\n\nWhat is wrong in the following code?\ngestures %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = status), fill = Macroarea) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\nIn the plot above it is difficult to assess whether different macroareas have different proportions of endangerment. This is because the overall number of languages per area differs between areas.\nA solution to this is to plot proportions instead of raw counts.\nYou could calculate the proportions yourself, but there is a quicker way: using the position argument in geom_bar().\nYou can plot proportions instead of counts by setting position = \"fill\" inside geom_bar(), like so:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot now shows proportions of languages by endangerment status for each area separately. (Note that the y-axis label is still “count” but it is in fact proportions; you will learn how to change labels next week).\nWith this plot it is easier to see that different areas have different proportions of endangerment. In writing:\n\nFigure 4 shows proportions of languages by endangerment status for each macroarea. Australia, South and North America have a substantially higher proportion of extinct languages than the other areas. These areas also have a higher proportion of near extinct languages. On the other hand, Africa has the greatest proportion of non-endangered languages followed by Papunesia and Eurasia, while North and South America are among the areas with the lower proportion, together with Australia which has the lowest."

Check the documentation with ?facet_grid() (especially the examples) to see how it works and then complete the code below and run it to produce a plot with two column panels for musicstudent.\n\npolite %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(f0mn, H1H2, colour = gender)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_grid(...)\n\nThis should be the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure shows mean f0 and H1-H2 difference as a scatter plot. The two panels indicate whether the participant was a student of music. Within each panel, the participant’s gender is represented by colour (red for female and blue for male). Male participants tend to have higher H1-H2 differences and lower mean f0 than females. From the plot it can also be seen that there is greater variability in H1-H2 difference in female music students compared to female non-music participants. Within each group of gender by music student there does not seem to be any specific relation between mean f0 and H1-H2 difference."
