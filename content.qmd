### Week 1

::: {.callout-important collapse="false"}
#### Learning Objectives

**Questions**

-   What is quantitative data analysis?
-   Is statistics a science, an art, or both?
-   How do uncertainty and variability affect data analysis?

**Skills**

-   Think critically about statistics, uncertainty and variability.

:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
#### Homework

**Course website**

-   Carefully read the [homepage](index.qmd).

-   Familiarise yourself with this *Course content* page (note that the materials will be updated throughout the course).

**Intake form**

-   The link to the form can be found on the Learn website.

**OPTIONAL: Install R, RStudio and Quarto**

-   The labs will take place in the PPLS computer lab which will have all the necessary software (hopefully...).
-   If instead you wish to use your own laptop, you are welcome to do so provided you take care of installing everything and fix issues that might arise. We won't be able to help you with the installation process.
-   Please, follow the instructions in the [Setup](setup.qmd) page.
