## Data transformation

**Data transformation** is a fundamental aspect of data analysis.

After the data you need to use is imported into R, you will have to filter rows, create new columns, or join data frames, among many other transformation operations.

In this tutorial we will learn how to `filter()` the data and `mutate()` or create new columns. In Week 6 (after Flexible Learning week) you will learn how to obtain summary measures and how to count occurrences using the `summarise()`, `group_by()` and `count()` functions.

## Filter

Filtering data based on specific criteria couldn't be easier with `filter()`, from the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) package (one of the tidyverse core packages),

Let's work with the `coretta2022/glot_status` data frame. It's an `.rds` file, so you need to use the `readRDS()` function. Go ahead and read the data into `glot_status`.

The `glot_status` data frame contains the endangerment status for 7,845 languages from [Glottolog](https://glottolog.org). There are thousands of languages in the world, but most of them are losing speakers, and some are already no longer spoken. The endangerment `status` of a language in the data is on a scale from `not endangered` (languages with large populations of speakers) through `threatened`, `shifting` and `nearly extinct`, to `extinct` (languages that have no living speakers left).

```{r}
#| label: glot-status
#| echo: false

glot_status <- readRDS("data/coretta2022/glot_status.rds")
```

```{r}
#| label: glot-status-2

glot_status
```

Before we can move on onto filtering data, we first need to learn about *logical operators*.

### Logical operators

There are four main logical operators:

-   `x == y`: `x` equals `y`.

-   `x != y`: `x` is not equal to `y`.

-   `x > y`: `x` is greater than `y`.

-   `x < y`: `x` is smaller than `y`.

Logical operators return `TRUE` or `FALSE` depending on whether the statement they convey is true or false. Remember, `TRUE` and `FALSE` are logical values.

Try these out in the Console:

```{r}
#| label: logic

# This will return FALSE
1 == 2

# FALSE
"apples" == "oranges"

# TRUE
10 > 5

# FALSE
10 > 15

# TRUE
3 < 4

```

::: callout-tip
#### Logical operators

**Logical operators** are symbols that compare two objects and return either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

The most common logical operators are `==`, `!=`, `>`, and `<`.
:::

::: callout-note
#### Quiz 2

```{r}
#| label: quiz-2
#| results: asis
#| echo: false

opts_2a <- c(
  "`3 > 1`",
  answer = '`"a" = "a"`',
  '`"b" != "b"`',
  "`19 < 2`"
)

cat("a. Which of the following does not contain a logical operator?", longmcq(opts_2a))

opts_2b <- c(
  "`3 > c(1, 5)`",
  answer = '`c("a", "b") != c("a")`',
  '`"apple" != "apple"`'
)

cat("b. Which of the following returns `c(FALSE, TRUE)`?", longmcq(opts_2b))
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Hint

**2a.**

Check for errors in the logical operators.

**2b.**

Run them in the console to see the output.
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
#### Explanation

**2a.**

The logical operator `==` has TWO equal signs. A single equal sign `=` is an alternative way of writing the assignment operator `<-`, so that `a = 1` and `a <- 1` are equivalent.

**2b.**

Logical operators are "vectorised" (you will learn more about this below), i.e they are applied sequentially to all elements in pairs. If the number of elements on one side does not match than of the other side of the operator, the elements on the side that has the smaller number of elements will be recycled.
:::
:::

Now let's see how these work with `filter()`!

### The `filter()` function

Filtering in R with the tidyverse is straightforward. You can use the `filter()` function.

`filter()` takes one or more statements with logical operators.

Let's try this out. The following code filters the `status` column so that only the `extinct` status is included in the new data frame `extinct`.

You'll notice we are using the pipe `|>` to transfer the data into the `filter()` function; the output of the filter function is assigned `<-` to `extinct`. The flow might seem a bit counter-intuitive but you will get used to think like this when writing R code soon enough!

```{r}
#| label: extinct

extinct <- glot_status |>
  filter(status == "extinct")

extinct
```

Neat! What if we want to include *all statuses except* `extinct`? Easy, we use the non-equal operator `!=`.

```{r}
#| label: not-extinct

not_extinct <- glot_status |>
  filter(status != "extinct")

not_extinct
```

And if we want only non-extinct languages from `South America`? We can include multiple statements separated by a comma!

```{r}
#| label: south-america

south_america <- glot_status |>
  filter(status != "extinct", Macroarea == "South America")

south_america
```

Combining statements like this will give you only those rows where both conditions apply. You can add as many statements as you need.

Now try to filter the data so that you include only `not_endangered` languages from all macro-areas except `Eurasia`. This time, don't save the output to a new data frame. What happens? Where is the output shown?

```{r}
#| label: glot-ex
#| eval: false

glot_status |>
  filter(...)
```

This is all great, but what if we want to include more than one status or macro-area?

To do that we need another operator: `%in%`.

### The `%in%` operator

::: callout-tip
#### `%in%`

The `%in%` operator is a special logical operator that returns `TRUE` if the value to the left of the operator is one of the values in the vector to its right, and `FALSE` if not.
:::

Try these in the Console:

```{r}
#| label: in

# TRUE
5 %in% c(1, 2, 5, 7)

# FALSE
"apples" %in% c("oranges", "bananas")
```

But `%in%` is even more powerful because the value on the left does not have to be a single value, but it can also be a vector! We say `%in%` is *vectorised* because it can work with vectors (most functions and operators in R are vectorised).

```{r}
#| label: in-vct

# TRUE, TRUE
c(1, 5) %in% c(4, 1, 7, 5, 8)

stocked <- c("durian", "bananas", "grapes")
needed <- c("durian", "apples")

# TRUE, FALSE
needed %in% stocked

```

Try to understand what is going on in the code above before moving on.

### Now filter the data

Now we can filter `glot_status` to include only the macro-areas of the Global South and only languages that are either "threatened", "shifting", "moribund" or "nearly_extinct". I have started the code for you, you just need to write the line for filtering `status`.

```{r}
#| label: global-south-ex
#| eval: false

global_south <- glot_status |>
  filter(
    Macroarea %in% c("Africa", "Australia", "Papunesia", "South America"),
    ...
  )
```

This should not look too alien! The first statement, `consonant %in% c("p", "t", "k")` looks at the `consonant` column and, for each row, it returns `TRUE` if the current row value is in `c("p", "t", "k")`, and `FALSE` if not.

```{r}
#| label: global-south
#| echo: false

global_south <- glot_status |>
  filter(
    Macroarea %in% c("Africa", "Australia", "Papunesia", "South America"),
    status %in% c("threatened", "shifting", "moribund", "nearly_extinct")
  )
```

## Bar charts

::: callout-tip
#### Bar charts

**Bar charts** are useful when you are counting things. For example:

-   Number of verbs vs nouns vs adjectives in a corpus.

-   Number of languages by geographic area.

-   Number of correct vs incorrect responses.

The bar chart geometry is `geom_bar()`.
:::

We will first create a plot with counts of the number of languages in `global_south` by their endangerment status and then a plot where we also split the counts by macro-area.

### Number of languages of the Global South by status

To create a bar chart, you can use the `geom_bar()` geometry.

::: callout-warning
#### Bar chart axes

In a simple bar chart, **you only need to specify one axis, the *x*-axis**, in the aesthetics `aes()`.

This is because the counts that are placed on the *y*-axis are calculated by the `geom_bar()` function under the hood.

This quirk is something that confuses many new learners, so make sure you internalise this.
:::

Go ahead and complete the following code to create a bar chart.

```{r}
#| label: status-bar-ex
#| eval: false

global_south |>
  ggplot(aes(x = status)) +
  ...
```

Note how we're using `|>` to pipe the `glot_status` data frame into the `ggplot()` function. This works because `ggplot()`'s first argument is the data, and piping is a different way of providing the first argument to a function.

As mentioned above, the counting for the *y*-axis is done automatically. R looks in the `status` column and counts how many times each value in the column occurs in the data frame.

If you did things correctly, you should get the following plot.

```{r}
#| label: fig-status-bar
#| fig-cap: "Number of languages by endangerment status."
#| echo: false

global_south |>
  ggplot(aes(x = status)) +
  geom_bar()
```

The *x*-axis is now `status` and the *y*-axis corresponds to the number of languages by status (`count`). As mentioned above, `count` is calculated under the hood for you (you will learn how to count levels with `count()` later in the course).

You could write a description of the plot that goes like this:

> The number of languages in the Global South by endangered status is shown as a bar chart in @fig-status-bar. Among the languages that are endangered, the majority are threatened or shifting.

What if we want to show the number of languages by endangerment status within each of the macro-areas that make up the Global South? Easy! You can make a stacked bar chart, but we will get to that after we first learn about `mutate()`.

## Mutate

To change existing columns or create new columns, we can use the `mutate()` function from the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) package.

To learn how to use `mutate()`, we will re-create the `status` column (let's call it `Status` this time) from the `Code_ID` column in `glot_status`.

The `Code_ID` column contains the status of each language in the form `aes-STATUS` where `STATUS` is one of `not_endangered`, `threatened`, `shifting`, `moribund`, `nearly_extinct` and `extinct`.

```{r}
#| label: codes
#| echo: false

unique(glot_status$Code_ID)
```

We want to create a new column called `Status` which has only the `STATUS` label (without the `aes-` part). To remove `aes-` from the `Code_ID` column we can use the `str_remove()` function from the [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org) package. Check the documentation of `?str_remove` to learn which arguments it uses.

```{r}
#| label: Status

glot_status <- glot_status |>
  mutate(
    Status = str_remove(Code_ID, "aes-")
  )
```

If you check `glot_status` now you will find that a new column, `Status`, has been added. This column is a character column (`chr`).

Let's reproduce the bar chart from above but with all the data from `glot_status`, using now the `Status` column.

```{r}
#| label: fig-status-bar-2
#| fig-cap: "Number of languages by endangerment status (repeated)."

glot_status |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Status)) +
  geom_bar()
```

But something is not quite right... The order of the levels of `Status` does not match the order that makes sense (from least to most endangered)! Why?

This is because `status` (the pre-existing column) is a **factor** column, rather than a simple character column. What is a factor vector/column?

::: callout-tip
#### Factor vector

A **factor vector** (or column) is a vector that contains a list of values (called *levels*) from a closed set.

The levels of a factor are ordered alphabetically by default.
:::

A vector/column can be mutated into a factor column with the `as.factor()` function. In the following code, we change the existing column `Status`, in other words we overwrite it (this happens automatically, because the `Status` column already exists, so it is replaced).

```{r}
#| label: as-factor

glot_status <- glot_status |>
  mutate(
    Status = as.factor(Status)
  )

# read below for an expanation of the dollar disgn $ syntax
levels(glot_status$Status)

```

The `levels()` functions returns the levels of a factor column in the order they are stored in the factor: by default the order is alphabetical. But wait, what is that `$` in `glot_status$Status`?

The dollar sign `$` a base R way of extracting a single column (in this case `Status`) from a data frame (`glot_status`).

::: callout-tip
#### The dollar sign \`\$\`

You can use the dollar sign `$` to extract a single column from a data frame as a vector.
:::

What if we want the levels of `Status` to be ordered in a more logical manner: `not_endangered`, `threatened`, `shifting`, `moribund`, `nearly_extinct` and `extinct`? Easy! We can use the `factor()` function instead of `as.factor()` and specify the levels and their order.

```{r}
#| label: factor

glot_status <- glot_status |>
  mutate(
    Status = factor(Status, levels = c("not_endangered", "threatened", "shifting", "moribund", "nearly_extinct", "extinct"))
  )

levels(glot_status$Status)
```

You see that now the order of the levels returned by `levels()` is the one we specified.

Transforming character columns to vector columns is helpful to specify a particular order of the levels which can then be used when plotting.

```{r}
#| label: fig-status-bar-3
#| fig-cap: "Number of languages by endangerment status (repeated)."

glot_status |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Status)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## Stacked bar charts

A special type of bar charts are the so-called stacked bar charts.

::: callout-tip
#### Stacked bar chart

A **stacked bar chart** is a bar chart in which each contains a "stack" of shorter bars, each indicating the counts of some sub-groups.

This type of plot is useful to show how counts of something vary depending on some other grouping (in other words, when you want to count the occurrences of a categorical variable based on another categorical variable). For example:

-   Number of languages by endangerment status, grouped by geographic area.

-   Number of infants by head-turning preference, grouped by first language.

-   Number of past vs non-past verbs, grouped by verb class.
:::

To create a stacked bar chart, you just need to add a new aesthetic mapping to `aes()`: `fill`. The `fill` aesthetic lets you fill bars or areas with different colours depending on the values of a specified column.

Let's make a plot on language endangerment by macro-area.

Complete the following code by specifying that `fill` should be based on `status`.

```{r}
#| label: status-stacked-ex
#| eval: false

global_south |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Macroarea, ...)) +
  geom_bar()
```

You should get the following.

```{r}
#| label: fig-status-stacked
#| fig-cap: "Number of languages by macro-area and endangerment status."
#| echo: false

global_south |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Macroarea, fill = status)) +
  geom_bar()
```

A write-up example:

> @fig-status-stacked shows the number of languages by geographic macro-area, subdivided by endangerment status. Africa, Eurasia and Papunesia have substantially more languages than the other areas.

::: callout-note
#### Quiz 4

What is wrong in the following code?

``` r
gestures |>
  ggplot(aes(x = status), fill = Macroarea) +
  geom_bar()
```
:::

## Filled stacked bar charts

In the plot above it is difficult to assess whether different macro-areas have different proportions of endangerment. This is because the overall number of languages per area differs between areas.

A solution to this is to plot **proportions** instead of raw counts.

You could calculate the proportions yourself, but there is a quicker way: using the `position` argument in `geom_bar()`.

You can plot proportions instead of counts by setting `position = "fill"` inside `geom_bar()`, like so:

```{r}
#| label: fig-status-stacked-2
#| fig-cap: "Proportion of languages by macro-area and endangerment status."

global_south |>
ggplot(aes(x = Macroarea, fill = status)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

The plot now shows proportions of languages by endangerment status for each area separately.

Note that the *y*-axis label is still "count" but should be "proportion" .Use `labs()` to change the axes labels and the legend name.

```{r}
#| label: status-stacked-3-ex
#| eval: false

global_south |>
ggplot(aes(x = Macroarea, fill = status)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(
    ...
  )
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Hint

If to change the name of the `colour` legend, you use the `colour` argument in `labs()`, guess which argument you should use for `fill`?
:::

You should get this.

```{r}
#| label: fig-status-stacked-3
#| fig-cap: "Proportion of languages by macro-area and endangerment status."
#| echo: false

global_south |>
ggplot(aes(x = Macroarea, fill = status)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(
    x = "Macro-area",
    y = "Proportion",
    fill = "Endangerment"
  )
```

With this plot it is easier to see that different areas have different proportions of endangerment. In writing:

> @fig-status-stacked-3 shows proportions of languages by endangerment status for each macro-area. Australia, South and North America have a substantially higher proportion of extinct languages than the other areas. These areas also have a higher proportion of near extinct languages. On the other hand, Africa has the greatest proportion of non-endangered languages followed by Papunesia and Eurasia, while North and South America are among the areas with the lower proportion, together with Australia which has the lowest.

## Faceting and panels

Sometimes we might want to separate the data into separate panels within the same plot.

We can achieve that easily using **faceting**.

### Polite again

Let's reproduce [this plot](tutorial-w04.qmd#lets-add-geometries) from Week 4, but this time let's spice things up.

This is the plot you made in Week 4. Try and reproduce it by writing the code yourself (you also have to read in the data!).

```{r}
#| label: fig-polite
#| fig-cap: "Scatter plot of mean f0 and H1-H2 difference."
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

polite <- read_csv("data/winter2012/polite.csv")

ggplot(
  data = polite,
  mapping = aes(x = f0mn, y = H1H2)
) +
  geom_point()
```

### Does being a music student matter?

That looks great, but we want to know if being a music student has an effect on the relationship of `f0mn` and `H1H2`.

In the plot above, the aesthetics mappings are the following:

-   `f0mn` on the *x*-axis.
-   `H1H2` on the *y*-axis.
-   `gender` as colour.

How can we separate data further depending on whether the participant is a music student or not (`musicstudent`)?

We can create panels using `facet_grid()`. This function takes lists of variables to specify panels in rows and/or columns.

#### Faceting

**Faceting** a plot allows to split the plot into multiple panels, arranged in rows and columns, based on one or more variables.

To facet a plot, use the `facet_grid()` function.

The syntax is a bit strange. You can specify rows of panels with the `rows` argument and columns of panels with `cols` argument, but you have to include column names inside `vars()`, like this:

```{r}
#| label: fig-polite-facet
#| fig-cap: "Scatter plot of mean f0 and H1-H2 difference in non-music students (left) vs music students (right)."
#| warning: false

polite |>
  ggplot(aes(f0mn, H1H2, colour = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(musicstudent)) +
  labs(
    x = "Mean f0 (Hz)",
    y = "H1-H2 difference (dB)",
    colour = "Gender"
  )
```

You could write a description of this plot like this:

> @fig-polite-facet shows mean f0 and H1-H2 difference as a scatter plot. The two panels indicate whether the participant was a student of music. Within each panel, the participant's gender is represented by colour (red for female and blue for male). Male participants tend to have higher H1-H2 differences and lower mean f0 than females. From the plot it can also be seen that there is greater variability in H1-H2 difference in female music students compared to female non-music participants. Within each group of gender by music student there does not seem to be any specific relation between mean f0 and H1-H2 difference.

The `polite` data also has a column `attitude` with values `inf` for informal and `pol` for polite. Subjects were asked to speak either as if they were talking to a friend (`inf` attitude) or to someone with a higher status (`pol` attitude).

Recreate the last plot, this time faceting also by `attitude`. Use the `rows` column to create two separate rows for each value of `attitude`.

```{r}
#| label: fig-polite-facet-2
#| eval: false

polite |>
  ggplot(aes(f0mn, H1H2, colour = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(musicstudent), rows = ...)
```

Now write a description of the plot.
