## Rmarkdown

Last week, you learnt how to use R scripts to save your code.

Keeping track of the code you use for data analysis is a very important aspect of research project managing: not only the code is there if you need to rerun it later, but it allows your data analysis to be **reproducible** (i.e., it can be reproduced by you or other people in such a way that starting with the same data and code you get to the same results).

::: callout-tip
#### Reproducible research

Research is **reproducible** when the same data and same code return the same results.
:::

R scripts are great for writing code, and you can even document the code (add explanations or notes) with comments (i.e. lines that start with `#`).

But for longer text or complex data analysis reports, R scripts can be a bit cumbersome.

A solution to this is using Rmarkdown files (they have the `.Rmd` extension).

### Code... and text!

Rmarkdown is a file format that allows you to mix code and formatted text in the same file.

This means that you can write **dynamic reports** using Rmd files: dynamic reports are just like analysis reports (i.e. they include formatted text, plots, tables, code output, code, etc...) but they are **dynamic** in the sense that if, for example, data or code changes, you can just rerun the report Rmd file and all code output (plots, tables, etc...) is updated accordingly!

You can watch this short video for a quick tour.

{{< video https://vimeo.com/178485416 >}}

::: callout-tip
#### Dynamic reports in R Markdown

**R Markdown** is a file type with extension `.Rmd` in which you can write formatted text and code together.

R Markdown can be used to generate **dynamic reports**: these are files that are generated automatically from the R Markdown source, ensuring data and results in the report are always up to date.
:::

### Formatting text

R comments in R scripts cannot be formatted (for example, you can't make bold or italic texts).

Text in Rmd files can be fully formatted using a simple but powerful **mark-up language** called [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org).

You don't have to learn markdown all in one go, so I encourage you to just learn it bit by bit, in your time. You can look at the the [Markdown Guide]() for an in-depth intro and/or dive in the [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com) for a hands-on approach.

A few quick pointers (you can test them in the [Markdown Live Preview](https://markdownlivepreview.com)):

-   Text can be made italics by enclosing it between single stars: `*this text is in italics*`.

-   You can make text bold with two stars: `**this text is bold!**`.

-   Headings are created with `#`: `# This is a level-1 heading`. `## This is a level-2 heading`.

::: callout-tip
#### Mark-up, Markdown

A **mark-up language** is a text-formatting system consisting of symbols or keywords that control the structure, formatting or relationships of textual elements. The most common mark-up languages are HTML, XML and TeX.

**Markdown** is a simple yet powerful mark-up language.
:::

### Create an Rmd file

::: callout-warning
#### Important

When working through these tutorials, always **make sure you are in the course RStudio Project** you just created.

You know you are in an RStudio Project because you can see the name of the Project in the top-right corner of RStudio, next to the light-blue cube icon.

If you see `Project (none)` in the top-right corner, that means **you are not** in an RStudio Project.

To make sure you are in the RStudio project, you can open the project by going to the project folder in File Explorer (Win) or Finder (macOS) and double click on the `.Rproj` file.
:::

To create a new Rmd file, just click on the `New file` button, then `R Markdown...`. (If you are asked to install/update packages, do so.)

![](/img/new-rmd.png)

A window will open. Add a title of your choice and your name, then click `OK`.

![](/img/new-rmd-window.png)

A new Rmd file will be created and will open in the File Editor panel in RStudio.

**Note** that creating an Rmd file does not automatically saves it on your computer. To do so, either use the keyboard short-cut `CMD+S`/`CTRL+S` or click on the floppy disk icon in the menu below the file tab.

![](/img/save-rmd.png)

Save the file inside the `code/` folder with the following name: `tutorial-w03.Rmd`.

Remember that all the files of your RStudio project don't live inside RStudio but on your computer. So you can always access them from the Finder or File Explorer!

### Parts of an Rmd file

An Rmd file usually has three main parts:

-   The preamble (green).

-   Code chunks (orange).

-   Text (blue).

![](/img/rmd-parts.png)

Each Rmd file has to start with a preamble, but you can include as many code chunks and as much text as you wish, in any order.

::: callout-tip
#### R Markdown: Preamble

The **preamble** of an `.Rmd` file contains a list of `key: value` pairs, used to specify settings or document info like the `title` and `author`.

Preambles start and end with three dashes `---`.
:::

::: callout-tip
#### R Markdown: Code chunks

**Code chunks** start and end with three back-ticks ```` ``` ```` and they contain code.

Settings can be specified between curly brackets `{}` on the first ```` ``` ```` line: for example `{r chunk-name, eval=FALSE}`. `r` indicates that the code is R code.
:::

### Render Rmd files to HTML

You can render an Rmd file into a nicely formatted HTML file.

To render an Rmd file, just click on the **Knit** button and an HTML file will be created and saved in the same location of the Rmd file.

![](/img/knit.png)

It will also be shown in the Viewer pane (like in the picture below) or in a new window (you can set this option in the RStudio preferences \> R Markdown \> Basics \> Show output preview in...).

![](/img/rendered.png)

Rendering Rmd files is not restricted to HTML, but also PDFs and even Word documents!

This is very handy when you are writing an analysis report you need to share with others.

::: callout-tip
#### R Markdown: Rendering

Rmd files can be **rendered** into other formats, like HTML, PDF and Word documents.
:::

### How to run code

The first code chunk in an Rmd file is a special one: it's called `setup` and it's where you attach all the packages needed for running the code in the file. (You can find the name of a code chunk---or define one yourself!---in the first line of a code block: ```` ```{r chunk-name} ````). The first code chunk of an Rmd file should always be named `setup`.

The `setup` code chunk also has special code from the knitr package. The knitr package is what allows you to run R code from Rmd files.

The line `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)` sets the option `echo` to `TRUE`. The `echo` option let's you decide whether you want the R code printed (echoed) in the rendered Rmd file. When `echo = TRUE` the code is printed, when `echo = FALSE` the code is not printed.

Now go ahead and add `library(tidyverse)` in the line below the `knitr::opts_chunk` line.

::: callout-note
#### Running code

To run the code of a code chunk you can use different approaches:

-   Click on the green arrow to the right of the code chunk to run the entire code chunk.

-   Alternatively, place the text cursor inside the code chunk and press `CMD/CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER`.

-   You can also run line by line as you do in an R script by placing the text cursor on the line you want to run and press `CMD/CTRL + ENTER`.
:::

Now delete everything after the `setup` code chunk and write a new level-2 heading after the chunk with the name "Plotting basics". (Remember to leave an empty line between the chunk and the heading.)

![](/img/rmd-setup.png)

You will use this Rmd file to write text and code for this tutorial. To insert a new code chunk, you can click on the `Insert a new code chunk` button and then select `R`, or you can press `OPT/ALT + CMD/CTRL + I`.

![](/img/rmd-new-chunk.png)

A new R code chunk will be inserted at the text cursor position.

## Data transformation

**Data transformation** is a fundamental aspect of data analysis.

After the data you need to use is imported into R, you will have to filter rows, create new columns, or join data frames, among many other transformation operations.

In this tutorial we will learn how to obtain summary measures and how to count occurrences using the `summarise()` and `count()` functions.

### Summary measures

During the lecture, we have learnt two types of measures.

::: callout-tip
#### Summary measures

**Measures of central tendency** (mean, median, mode) indicate the typical or central value of a sample.

**Measures of dispersion** (min-max, range, standard deviation) indicate the dispersion of the sample values around the central tendency value.
:::

When you work with data, you always want to get summary measures for most of the variables in the data.

Data reports usually include summary measures. It is also important to understand which summary measure is appropriate for which type of variable.

We have covered this in the lecture, so we won't go over it again here. Instead, you will learn how to obtain summary measures using the `summarise()` function from the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) tidyverse package.

`summarise()` takes at least two arguments:

-   The data frame to summarise.

-   One or more summary functions.

For example, let's get the mean the reaction time column `RT`. Easy!

```{r}
#| label: mean

summarise(shallow, RT_mean = mean(RT))

```

Great! The mean reaction times of the entire sample is 867 ms.

What if we want also the standard deviation? Easy!

```{r}
#| label: sd

summarise(shallow, RT_mean = mean(RT), RT_sd = sd(RT))

```

```{r}
#| label: comments-2

# This is a comment. Let's add 6 + 3.
6 + 3
```

Now we know that reaction times are on average 867 ms long and have a standard deviation of about 293 ms (rounded to the nearest integer).

Let's go all the way and also get the minimum and maximum RT values.

```{r}
#| label: minmax

summarise(
  shallow,
  RT_mean = mean(RT), RT_sd = sd(RT),
  RT_min = min(RT), RT_max = max(RT)
)

```

Fab! When writing a data report, you could write something like this.

> Reaction times are on average 867 ms long (SD = 293 ms), with values ranging from 0 to 1994 ms.

We will learn more about standard deviations from Week 4 on, but for now just think of this as a relative measure of how dispersed the data are around the mean: the higher the SD, the greater the dispersion around the mean, i.e. the greater the variability in the data.

When required, you can use the `median()` function to calculate the median, instead of the `mean()`. Go ahead and calculate the median reaction times in the data. Is it similar to the mean?

#### Quiz 5

```{r}
#| label: quiz-5
#| results: asis
#| echo: false

opts_5a <- c(
   "It changes `NA`s to `FALSE`.",
   "It converts `NA`s to `0`s.",
   answer = "It removes `NA`s before taking the mean."
)

cat("a. What does the `na.rm` argument of `mean()` do?", longmcq(opts_5a))

opts_5b <- c(
   answer = "`NA`.",
   "`0`.",
   "`10.66`."
)

cat("b. Which is the mean of `c(4, 23, NA, 5)` when `na.rm` has the default value?", longmcq(opts_5b))
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Hint

Check the documentation of `?mean`.
:::
:::

Note that R has a `mode()` function, but alas this is not the statistical mode. To get the mode of a categorical variable you can just count the occurrences of the values of that variable and the value that occurs the most is the mode!

Keep reading to learn how to count occurrences.

### Count occurrences

We can use the `count()` function from the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) tidyverse package to count the number of occurrences for each value of a specific column. Let's count how many trials are correct, i.e. let's count occurrences in the `ACC` column.

Accuracy has been coded with `0` for incorrect and `1` for correct. We will see how this is not an ideal, although very common way, of coding binary variables. For now let's keep it as is.

The function `count()` takes the name of tibble and the name of column you want to count values in.

```{r count-corr, eval=FALSE}
#| label: count-corr

count(shallow, ACC)

```

How many *correct* responses are there in the `shallow` tibble?

Note that you can add **multiple column names, separated by commas**, to get counts for the combinations of values of each column.

Try to get counts of the combination of `ACC` and `Group` (`L1` vs `L2` participants). Replace `...` with the right code.

```{r count-corr-group, eval=FALSE}
count(shallow, ...)
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Hint

In `count()`, include the names of the two columns you want to get counts of, separated by commas.
:::

Are there differences in accuracy between the L1 and L2 group?

### Grouping data

Sometimes you might want to get summary measures for one variable depending on different values of another variable.

You can use the `group_by()` function from the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) tidyverse package, together with `summarise()` to achieve that. Let's see how it works.

```{r}
#| label: group

group_by(shallow, Group) %>%
  summarise(
    RT_mean = mean(RT),
    RT_sd = sd(RT)
  )

```

The `group_by()` function takes at least two arguments:

-   The name of the tibble to group.

-   The name of the columns to group the tibble by, separated by commas.

Here we are grouping `shallow` by `Group`.

If you are baffled by that `%>%`, keep on reading.

### What the pipe?!

Wait, what is that thing, `%>%`?

It's called a **pipe**. Think of a pipe as a teleporter.

In the code above we are chaining two functions together using the pipe opeartor `%>%`. The output of the first function (`group_by()`) is "teleported" into the second function `summarise()`.

The pipe `%>%` teleports the output of the preceding function as the first argument of the following function. The output of `group_by` is a (grouped) tibble, and `summarise()` needs a tibble as its first argument.

That's why the code above works!

In fact, you can even use a pipe for the tibble of `group_by()`, like so:

```{r}
#| label: pipe

shallow %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
    summarise(
      RT_mean = mean(RT),
      RT_sd = sd(RT)
    )

```

You see that the output of the code is the same here as it is above.

For comparison, this is what the code would look like without the pipe.

```{r}
#| label: no-pipe

grouped_shallow <- group_by(shallow, Group)

summarise(
  grouped_shallow,
  RT_mean = mean(RT),
  RT_sd = sd(RT)
)

```

Don't worry too much if the concept of the pipe is not clear yet. It should become clearer later.

#### Quiz 6

```{r}
#| label: quiz-6
#| results: asis
#| echo: false

opts_6a <- c(
   "`count(shallow, Target)`.",
   answer = "`shallow %>% distinct(Target) %>% count()`.",
   "`shallow %>% count(Target)`."
)

cat("a. Which of the following returns the number of words in `shallow`?", longmcq(opts_6a))

cat("b. The output of `summarise()` always drops the grouping.", torf(FALSE))
```

#### Practice 2

-   Go to <https://github.com/stefanocoretta/infant-gestures> and download the `gestures.csv` file in the `data/` folder. This is data from the paper \[A Cross-Cultural Analysis of Early Prelinguistic Gesture Development and Its Relationship to Language Development\](https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.13406).

-   Read the file in R.

-   Calculate the following:

    -   Measure of central tendency and dispersion for the `count` column (it contains the number of gestures performed by each child in different tasks).

    -   Measure of central tendency and dispersion for the `count`column grouped by `month` (the child's age).

    -   Total number of gestures by children (`dyad`).

    -   Number of children by `background`.

-   Write a short paragraph where you report the measures. You can right this as comments in your R script. For examples, see above.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Hint

-   To calculate the total number of gestures by children, you need the `sum()` function.

-   To calculate the number of children by background, you need the `distinct()` function.

## Summary

That's all for this week!

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**R Markdown**

-   **R Markdown** can be used to create dynamic and reproducible reports.

-   **Mark-up languages** are text-formatting systems that specify text formatting and structure using symbols or keywords. Markdown is the mark-up language R Markdown is based on.

-   The main parts of an `.Rmd` file are the preamble, text and code chunks.

**Plotting**

-   **ggplot2** is a plotting package from the tidyverse.

    -   To create a basic plot, you use the `ggplot()` function and specify `data` and `mapping`.

    -   The `aes()` function allows you to specify aesthetics (like axes, colours, ...) in the `mapping` argument.

    -   Geometries map data values onto shapes in the plot. All geometry functions are of the type `geom_*()`.

-   **Scatter plots** are created with `geom_point()` and can be used with two numeric variables.

-   **Bar charts** are created with `geom_bar()` and can be used to show the counts of different levels of a categorical variable.

-   **Stacked bar charts** are created by specifying the `fill` aesthetic and can be used to show counts grouped by a second categorical variable.

-   **Stacked bar charts showing proportions** can be created with the argument `position = "fill"` in `geom_bar()`.

-   **Faceting** allows you to split the plot in different panels, based on other variables in the data. Faceting is achieved with `facet_grid()`.
:::

Next week, we will start learning about statistical modelling and while doing that you will also learn how to create density and violin plots and how to customise legends, titles and labels!
