## Course rationale

::: {.bg-washed-blue .b--dark-blue .ba .bw2 .br3 .shadow-5 .ph4 .mt2}
-   **DAL (Data Analysis for LEL)** is a new course designed for undergraduate students.

-   The main learning objective of this course is to allow you to **conduct basic data reports** which can be applied to linguistic questions and data, for example as part of your dissertation.

-   We will focus on **modern techniques** of data handling and quantitative analysis.

::: {.bg-washed-yellow .b--orange .ba .bw2 .br3 .shadow-5 .ph4 .mt2}
-   This is **not a programming course**. (For that, see the [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz) book).

-   There will be little maths.

-   The course covers the basics, but you will very likely have to learn something extra for your dissertation.

-   We will not cover inferential statistics (including significance testing).
