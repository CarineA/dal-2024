## Data Management Plan (DMP)

::: {.bg-washed-blue .b--dark-blue .ba .bw2 .br3 .shadow-5 .ph4 .mt2}
A **Data Management Plan** (DMP) covers data types and volume, capture, storage, integrity, confidentiality, retention and destruction, sharing and deposit.

-   [UoE Research Data Management policy](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/about/policies-and-regulations/research-data-policy).

## Research Compendium

> A **research compendium** accompanies, enhances, or is a scientific publication providing data, code, and documentation for reproducing a scientific workflow.

---[Research Compendium](https://research-compendium.science)

. . .

> A **research compendium** is a collection of all digital parts of a research project including data, code, texts (protocols, reports, questionnaires, meta data). The collection is created in such a way that reproducing all results is straightforward.

## Organise files

::: {.bg-washed-blue .b--dark-blue .ba .bw2 .br3 .shadow-5 .ph4 .mt2}
-   Create one folder and make that the folder for your dissertation project.

-   In that folder, create folders for `data/` and for `scripts/` (and `plots/`, `dissertation/`, etc).
:::

. . .

::: {.bg-washed-green .b--dark-green .ba .bw2 .br3 .shadow-5 .ph4 .mt2}
-   In `data/` have a `raw/` and `derived/` folder:

    -   Raw data (data that, if lost, it is very unfortunate; for example, experiment data, data which was manually annotated, etc) should be saved in `data/raw/`.

    -   Derived data (data that is derived with scripts) should be saved in `data/derived/`.

## Back up

::: {.bg-washed-red .b--dark-red .ba .bw2 .br3 .shadow-5 .ph4 .mt2}
**Make sure you have a backup system in place.**
:::

. . .

::: {.bg-washed-blue .b--dark-blue .ba .bw2 .br3 .shadow-5 .ph4 .mt2}
-   Save copies of the entire folder in an external hard drive.

-   Saving copies of the entire folder in an online storage service (iCloud Drive, One Drive, DropBox, Google Drive, ...).

    -   But if you are working on that copy via syncing, make sure you have a second independent place you back up to, like a hard drive.

-   Using a versioning system like [git](https://www.atlassian.com/git).
:::

## Research projects are dynamic

::: {.bg-washed-blue .b--dark-blue .ba .bw2 .br3 .shadow-5 .ph4 .mt2}
-   Be prepared to change how files and folders are organised after you start.

-   Projects evolve over time and sometimes you need to clean things up.
:::

. . .

::: {.bg-washed-green .b--dark-green .ba .bw2 .br3 .shadow-5 .ph4 .mt2}
-   Use a good system to **mark versions** in your files. Two simple systems:

    -   Use full DATE in the file name
        -   `dissertation-2022-11-21`.
        -   `dissertation-2023-03-01`.
    -   Or use version number
        -   Inspired by [Semantic versioning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-semantic-versioning/) from programming but can be helpful with research files too!
        -   `dissertation-v1.0`.
        -   `dissertation-v1.1`.
        -   `dissertation-v2.0`.

## Licensing

::: {.bg-washed-blue .b--dark-blue .ba .bw2 .br3 .shadow-5 .ph4 .mt2}
A **license** gives someone official permission to reuse something while protecting the intellectual property of the original creator.
:::

::: {.bg-washed-green .b--dark-green .ba .bw2 .br3 .shadow-5 .ph4 .mt2}
**Use open licenses** to ensure the data/code can be used by other researchers.

The [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/) are now common in research.
