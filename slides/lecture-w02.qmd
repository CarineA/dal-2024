## Research questions and hypotheses

**Research question**

- Research questions are **testable questions** whose answers directly address the research problem.

**Research hypotheses**

- Research hypotheses are **testable statements** (not questions) about the research problem.

- The hypotheses must be **falsifiable** (there can be in principle an outcome that shows them to be false).

- Hypotheses can never be true nor confirmed. We can only **corroborate** hypothesis, and it's a long term process.

## Research cycle: the dangers

![](/img/res-process-cycle-qrps.png){fig-align="center"}

## Replication in linguistics

> \[O\]nly **1 in 1,250** experimental linguistic articles contains an independent direct replication.

> The observed smaller number of citations of replication studies compared to corresponding initial studies is also in line with the **lack of perceived value of replication** studies reported in other fields.

---[Korback and Roettger 2023](https://doi.org/10.5070/G6011135)

## Statistical power in linguistics

> An opportunistic review of seven papers from the November 2017 issue of this journal containing statistical analyses of acoustic speech production data found the **number of participants to range from 11 to 39**.

---[Kirby and Sonderegger 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2018.05.005)

> In group differences research, the **median sample sizes** (n = 18 and n = 14 for case and control groups, respectively) were **insufficient** for detecting large, medium, or small effect sizes.

---[Gaeta and Brydges 2020](https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_JSLHR-19-00299)

> \[O\]f the 1004 studies reviewed by Lehtonen et al. (2018) 878 had sample sizes **smaller than 50 participants per group** (i.e., 87%) and 987 had sample sizes smaller than 100 (98%).

---[Brysbaert 2020](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1366728920000437)

## Case study: participant number in prosody research

The dataset contains data from 113 studies, published between 1955 and 2017 (the bulk of studies is within the range 1990-2017 though). The **median number of speakers per study is 5**. ([An estimate of number of speakers per study in phonetics](https://stefanocoretta.github.io/posts/2019-05-03-speakers-per-study/), Coretta 2019).

## Reproducibility in linguistics

> 35% of the articles were published open access and the rates of **sharing materials, data, and protocols were below 10%**. None of the articles reported preregistrations, 1% reported replications, and 10% had conflict of interest statements. These rates have not increased noticeably between 2008/2009 and 2018/2019.

## Activity {background-color="var(--inverse)"}

-   Search for a paper you are interested in or that you have recently read.

-   Fill in the following spreadsheet with info on the paper you picked.

    -   [Spreadsheet](https://uoe-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/scoretta_ed_ac_uk/Ed4YqE6FhzJHlB0Nv-shPUkBSIm0xwgG7uvm2PAiTrOkXw?e=BMaA2N%3E).

## Open Scholarship practices

::: {.bg-washed-blue .b--dark-blue .ba .bw2 .br3 .shadow-5 .ph4 .mt2}
-   Pre-registration and Registered Reports.

-   Share the Research Compendium (data, materials, code, etc).

-   Ensure your study is reproducible.

-   Think about sample size.
